- auto compacting the messages, when you are creating something, so all messages for a particular task are summarized and then grouped together to show you what you did for those 50 messages, like zooming out on a high level project, or something like that
- so instead of showing code, make that 2 levels deep, give them a shortened phrase of what the file is, therefore when creating any code, there will need to be a comment at the top with these facts about the file
    - short description
    - long description
    - language
    - anything else?
