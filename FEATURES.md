- who am I? agent profiles, like you have in Slack, be able to change how they act or what they focus on
- auto compacting the messages, when you are creating something, so all messages for a particular task are summarized and then grouped together to show you what you did for those 50 messages, like zooming out on a high level project, or something like that
- once the chat gets too long, can we summarize the chat up above rather than having all the text in some way? I'd like to make sure that we don't use a ton of context at some point, so we can summarize and list out bullet points or something like that so someone doesn't need to read all the chat if they don't want to but can look at the high level of what's been done. Does that make sense? What does the team recommend or what options do they have for something like this?
- if I refresh the page while it's generating a response I want to make sure I still get the message
- add a microphone button to each of the messages to play it with the system audio

- different personalities for the personas
- can i hire certain personalities?
- audio of what was said so i can talk back and forth"
- if they arent progressing, give them ideas
- lay out a roadmap for their journey that the agents should be following thats declarative
- need options on how to deploy and how to database
- how do the agents interact with each other like in a group text/channel/dm? are they periodically checking in? do they jave their own context window we store for them?
- badges, icons, profile
- landing page and SSO/auth
- notifications when a chat is done or ready for my response, like a text message would come in from the chat just like youd get from your team
- 

Suggestions
- with cost savings, let's have a special icon next to "Project Summary" like a money bag or dollar sign that you can click on to show the savings report instead of having it at the bottom of the Project Summary
- what can we do to test the code we have created so far? can we give the user a sneak peak of what the web app or what they create will be like?
- need to work with the context window and how much it can handle, summarizing previous chats
-
In the summary phase, there should be something that says, "If you feel like we have covered everything go ahead and click on the "Discovery Complete" button" Or something like that
-
An infinite amount fo users apears as 0
0 friends and family (casual feedback and input access)
-
The different personas should have different color messages on the edges and it should no longer have "root" at the top. beause it still says "Root" is the one responding, Is fixed when refreshed
-
When finished creating a large section of the process have something that congratulates for completing that section and give a very short summary of what this next persona is going to help with > make sure to have big picture all the time, like "these chats are for the home page" or "profile page" or "core logic services", just need a way to help the user know from a big picture stand point, where they are and what they are focused on. Where are they in the user journey of creating their app?
-
Introduce the new personas, have Root give a 1 sentence or phrase on the persona, and then have the persona introduce themselves briefly
-
Below I have listed one of the responces i got. I recomend Shortening how much reassurance. Maybe instead add reassurance that the program will be able to help me with my problem, that thi isnt too big and that there is an easy
Oh, that's such a relatable struggle! You're caught in that classic creative cycle where perfectionism meets indecision - you write something, step away, and then come back with fresh (and often critical) eyes. It's like being stuck in a creative loop where each version feels like it should be "the one," but none of them quite land right.

Like this:
    It sounds incredibly frustrating to put all that energy into writing, only to feel like you're back at square one. And I can see how this would completely block you from even getting to the illustration phase, which is probably the part you're excited about!

    Right now, when you get stuck or need to take a break, how do you keep track of all these different versions and ideas? And when you do return to work on it, what would need to be different for you to feel confident moving forward with a version?
