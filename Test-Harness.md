Discovery Flow Test Harness

1. I run a small bakery and do custom cake orders
2. I track orders on paper and WhatsApp - I keep losing track of what's due when
3. I want to see all my orders in one place and never miss a due date again
4. Just me and my two assistants. I need to see everything, they just need to view and add orders
5. Top 3 Items
6. Order list showing what's due
7. Form to add new orders
8. Due date alerts
9. Maybe a calendar view and customer history later
10. Looks good, let's start building!

I run a bakery. My biggest problem is tracking custom cake orders - I use paper and WhatsApp and keep losing track of due dates. Just me and 2 assistants use it (they only need to view/add orders, I need full access). For v1, I need: 1) order list with due dates, 2) add order form, 3) due date reminders. Calendar view can wait for later.
