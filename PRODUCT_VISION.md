## Vision Statement

We envision a world where small business owners can build custom software applications simply by having a conversation. By combining AI-powered guided discovery with automated development infrastructure, go-chat goes beyond code generation to teach users product thinking and systems design. We eliminate the developer bottleneck while empowering non-technical users to understand, create, deploy, and evolve their own applications from anywhere, at any time.

**Core Philosophy: "Code Without Coding"**

Users learn systems thinking, not syntax. The AI handles the "how" while users focus on the "what" and "why." Through progressive disclosure of technical complexity, users naturally advance from understanding their application's purpose to appreciating its architecture, creating a learning journey that bridges the gap between idea and implementation.

---

## Strategic Context

### Business Objectives

- **Primary Business Goal**: Democratize software development for small business owners who lack technical resources while teaching them to think like product builders
- **Revenue Impact**: Create a productized platform offering after internal validation, targeting subscription-based recurring revenue with premium tiers for advanced learning features
- **Market Opportunity**: The no-code/low-code market is projected to grow significantly, but current solutions still require technical understanding. Go-chat targets the true non-technical user segment that existing tools fail to serve, with the unique angle of teaching rather than just building.
- **Competitive Positioning**: First-to-market conversational development platform with guided product discovery, learning progression, and full DevOps integration

### Market Opportunity

**Market Trends**:
- AI-assisted development tools are maturing rapidly, enabling natural language to code generation
- Small businesses increasingly need custom software but cannot afford or find developers
- Remote work and mobile-first expectations mean business owners need access from anywhere
- Self-hosted and data sovereignty concerns are growing, especially for business applications
- Growing demand for educational platforms that teach practical skills through doing, not just watching

**Competitive Landscape**:
- No-code tools (Bubble, Retool, Airtable) require learning visual interfaces and still have technical concepts
- AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, Cursor) are designed for developers, not business owners
- Educational platforms teach coding syntax, not product thinking or systems design
- White space opportunity: Conversational interface that guides discovery, handles the entire lifecycle from idea to production, and teaches users to think systematically about software--all accessible to truly non-technical users

### Time Horizon

This 12-month vision focuses on proving the core concept and achieving product-market fit. The first 6 months concentrate on internal use and validation, months 7-12 on productization and early external customers. Beyond 12 months, the focus shifts to scaling, enterprise features, marketplace/template ecosystems, and advanced learning pathways.

## Target Users & Personas

### Primary Persona: Sam the Small Business Owner

**Who They Are**: Owner or operator of a small business (1-50 employees) who has ideas for tools and applications that could improve their business but lacks technical skills or budget to hire developers. They are comfortable with messaging apps and basic technology but not with coding, command lines, or technical infrastructure. They want to understand what they are building, not just receive a black box.

**Jobs-to-be-Done**:
1. **Functional job**: Build custom tools to run their business more efficiently (inventory tracking, customer management, workflow automation)
2. **Emotional job**: Feel empowered and in control of their technology, not dependent on expensive consultants or waiting in IT queues
3. **Social job**: Be seen as innovative and tech-savvy by peers and customers without needing to become technical
4. **Learning job**: Gain enough understanding of their application to make informed decisions about changes and improvements

**Current Pain Points**:
- **Developer bottleneck**: Either cannot afford developers, cannot find them, or face long wait times when they have ideas
- **Tool mismatch**: Off-the-shelf SaaS tools do not fit their specific business processes, leading to workarounds and manual processes
- **Lack of visibility**: When they do get apps built, they cannot understand what is happening with deployments, errors, or performance
- **No mental model**: They have no framework for thinking about software systematically, making it hard to communicate needs or evaluate solutions

**Success Criteria**: Sam can be guided through thinking about their product needs, see their application built and deployed, understand its structure through the App Map, check on it from their phone throughout the day, and progressively learn how it all connects together.

---

### Secondary Persona: Alex the Internal Stakeholder

**Who They Are**: Non-technical team member in a larger organization (marketing, operations, sales) who needs internal tools but faces long development backlogs. They understand their business domain deeply but rely on engineering teams for any technical implementation.

**Jobs-to-be-Done**:
1. **Functional job**: Get internal tools and dashboards built without waiting months for engineering resources
2. **Emotional job**: Feel autonomous and productive, not blocked by dependencies on other teams
3. **Social job**: Deliver results and be recognized for solving problems independently
4. **Learning job**: Develop enough technical literacy to have productive conversations with engineering when needed

**Current Pain Points**:
- **Backlog delays**: Engineering priorities rarely align with their needs; their requests sit in backlogs for quarters
- **Lost in translation**: When projects do get prioritized, requirements get misunderstood between business and technical teams
- **No iteration**: Once something is built, getting changes requires starting the request cycle over again
- **Knowledge gap**: They do not know how to think about software structure, making requirements unclear

**Success Criteria**: Alex can be guided through product discovery, have a conversation to build what they need, understand how components connect via the App Map, iterate on it in real-time, and own the tool without ongoing engineering dependency.

## Core Value Propositions

### For Sam the Small Business Owner

**Unique Value**: Not just build applications through conversation, but learn to think about products and systems while building them.

**Key Benefits**:
1. **Zero technical barrier**: Describe what you want in plain English; the AI handles all the technical translation
2. **Guided discovery**: Before any code is generated, AI guides you through defining your product vision, users, and MVP scope
3. **App Map understanding**: See your application organized by purpose ("Homepage", "Contact Form", "Backend Services") rather than confusing file paths
4. **Progressive learning**: Start with just understanding what things do, then naturally progress to seeing how they connect
5. **Mobile-first access**: Check on your applications, deployments, and logs from your phone throughout the day
6. **Full lifecycle ownership**: From idea to production to ongoing changes, all through the same conversational interface

**Differentiation**: Unlike no-code tools that still require learning visual programming, go-chat meets users where they are: in a guided conversation. Unlike AI coding assistants, go-chat handles infrastructure, deployment, and operations automatically while teaching users to think systematically about their applications.

### For Alex the Internal Stakeholder

**Unique Value**: Break free from engineering backlogs, build the internal tools you need, and develop the product thinking skills to communicate effectively with technical teams.

**Key Benefits**:
1. **Structured discovery**: AI guides you through product thinking before building, resulting in clearer requirements
2. **Immediate progress**: Start building the same day you have the idea, not months later
3. **Direct iteration**: Make changes yourself through conversation rather than filing tickets and waiting
4. **Business context preserved**: No more requirements lost in translation; you describe what you need in your own terms
5. **Growing technical literacy**: Progressively learn how software is structured, making future technical conversations more productive

**Differentiation**: Go-chat is not a ticketing system or a self-service portal; it is an AI collaborator that guides discovery, understands business needs, translates them into working software, and teaches you to think like a product builder.

## Product Principles

1. **People first, product second**: This platform is not about building software—it is about helping a real person solve their unique problem. We go to the user, understand their world, and craft a solution that fits their life. The application is just the vehicle; the human and their challenge are what matter.

2. **Teach, do not just build**: The goal is not just to give users an application, but to help them understand product thinking and systems design. Every interaction is an opportunity to educate.

3. **Guide before generating**: Before writing any code, guide users through discovery. Clarity of purpose leads to better applications and more satisfied users.

4. **Conversation over configuration**: Users should never need to fill out forms, configure settings, or learn interfaces. Everything happens through natural conversation.

5. **Purpose over paths**: Users think about "Homepage" and "Contact Form", not "src/pages/index.tsx". The App Map reflects how users mentally model their applications.

6. **Progressive disclosure**: Start simple (what things do), reveal complexity gradually (how things connect), and let users pull deeper when ready (the actual code). Never overwhelm.

7. **Invisible infrastructure**: The complexity of containers, pipelines, servers, and deployments should be completely hidden. Users think about their application, not the technology running it.

8. **Mobile-native design**: Assume users will check in from their phone throughout the day. Every feature must work well on mobile, not just be responsive as an afterthought.

9. **Plain language always**: Error messages, status updates, alerts, and explanations should be in plain English that a non-technical user can understand and act on. No jargon, no stack traces, no technical codes.

10. **Celebrate progression**: Learning should feel rewarding. Achievements, nudges, and recognition make users feel accomplished as they advance their understanding.

11. **Progress over perfection**: It is better to show users incremental progress and iterate based on feedback than to wait for a perfect solution. The conversational nature allows for continuous refinement.

## Scope Boundaries

### In Scope

- Web-based chat interface for application development conversations
- AI-powered guided discovery (vision, personas, MVP scope, roadmap)
- AI-powered natural language understanding and code generation
- App Map: Purpose-based file organization with functional groupings
- 2-Tier file reveal (descriptions first, code on request)
- 3-Level view progression (functional only to full technical)
- Learning achievements and progression tracking
- Devcontainer orchestration for isolated development environments
- Self-hosted GitLab integration for version control and CI/CD
- Automated deployment to production environments
- Mobile-responsive interface for monitoring and status
- Basic application types: CRUD apps, dashboards, workflow automation, integrations
- VS Code export pathway for advanced users
- Single-tenant architecture initially, multi-tenant by month 6

### Out of Scope (Not Yet)

- Native mobile apps (iOS/Android) - Web-first approach validates demand before native investment
- Enterprise SSO and advanced security features - Focus on small business first
- Marketplace for templates and components - Requires critical mass of users
- White-label/reseller program - Requires proven product-market fit
- Complex application architectures (microservices, event-driven) - Start with simpler patterns
- Offline functionality - Assume connectivity for MVP
- Full curriculum/course structure - Achievement system provides light gamification first
- Community features (user sharing, collaboration) - Focus on individual user experience first

### Strategic Trade-offs

- **Teaching over speed**: We invest time in guided discovery and progressive disclosure, accepting slightly longer time-to-first-app in exchange for better understanding and retention
- **Simplicity over power**: We chose to limit application complexity initially to ensure non-technical users can succeed, rather than supporting every possible application pattern
- **Self-hosted over SaaS**: We chose self-hosted GitLab integration to provide data control and appeal to security-conscious small businesses, accepting the additional operational complexity
- **Web over native mobile**: We chose mobile-responsive web over native apps to move faster and reach more platforms, accepting some UX limitations on mobile
- **Gamification over certification**: We chose lightweight achievements over formal learning certification to keep the experience fun and low-pressure

## Validation & Learning Plan

### Key Assumptions to Validate

1. **Non-technical users can articulate application needs clearly enough for AI interpretation**
   - **Validation Method**: Internal user testing with 5+ non-technical participants attempting to build applications
   - **Timeline**: Month 2

2. **Guided discovery improves application quality and reduces pivots**
   - **Validation Method**: Compare applications with and without discovery flow; measure change request rates
   - **Timeline**: Month 3

3. **Chat-based interaction is preferable to visual no-code tools for our target users**
   - **Validation Method**: User interviews and A/B testing with small business owners comparing approaches
   - **Timeline**: Month 3

4. **App Map organization is more intuitive than file trees for non-technical users**
   - **Validation Method**: User testing comparing App Map to traditional file tree; measure comprehension and task success
   - **Timeline**: Month 4

5. **Progressive disclosure encourages learning rather than creating dependence**
   - **Validation Method**: Track view level progression and VS Code export rates; user interviews about confidence
   - **Timeline**: Month 5

6. **Mobile check-ins provide meaningful value versus desktop-only access**
   - **Validation Method**: Usage analytics and user interviews once mobile interface is live
   - **Timeline**: Month 4

7. **Small business owners will pay for this capability**
   - **Validation Method**: Pricing research and early customer conversations about willingness to pay
   - **Timeline**: Month 6

### Validation Milestones

- **Month 3**: Core guided discovery + conversational development flow working end-to-end; 3+ internal users have successfully built and deployed applications; App Map prototype tested
- **Month 6**: Full 3-level view progression live; Mobile observability live; 10+ users actively using the platform; Learning achievements implemented; initial pricing validation complete
- **Month 12**: Multi-tenant platform supporting external customers; 50+ paying customers; 25%+ of users advancing to Level 3; clear path to sustainable unit economics
