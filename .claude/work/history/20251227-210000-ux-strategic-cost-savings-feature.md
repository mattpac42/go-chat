**Date**: 2025-12-27T21:00:00Z
**Agent**: strategic-ux-ui-designer
**Task**: Design "Cost Savings" UI feature showing AI agent vs human professional cost comparison

## Work Completed

Analyzed existing codebase patterns including:
- Component architecture (Tailwind CSS, React patterns)
- Existing summary cards (DiscoverySummaryCard, ProgressBadge)
- Layout patterns (sidebar, modal, inline cards)
- Color system (teal primary, gray neutrals, semantic colors)

## Design Strategy Deliverable

See detailed UI concepts and recommendation below.

## Recommendations

1. Implement Concept B (Integrated Summary Card) as the primary approach
2. Place in project completion flow and accessible via header button
3. Use existing card patterns for consistency
4. Include appropriate disclaimers about estimates
