# Product Strategic Session: Vision Document Update

**Date**: 2025-12-25
**Agent**: product-strategic
**Task**: Update PRODUCT_VISION.md with new strategic concepts

## Work Completed

Updated `/workspace/PRODUCT_VISION.md` from version 1.0 to 2.0, integrating six major new strategic concepts:

1. **"Code Without Coding" Philosophy** - Added to vision statement and woven throughout document
2. **Guided Discovery Phase** - Created new Theme 1: Guided Discovery & Systems Thinking
3. **App Map (Ontology-Based Organization)** - Integrated into Theme 2: Conversational Development
4. **2-Tier File Reveal System** - Added to Theme 2 feature domains
5. **3-Level View Progression** - Added to Theme 2 with detailed level definitions
6. **Learning Journey Integration** - Created new Theme 5: Learning Journey & Progression

## Decisions Made

- **Theme ordering**: Made Guided Discovery Theme 1 (foundational, before coding) and renumbered existing themes
- **App Map naming**: Consistently used "App Map" throughout, never "ontology" per instructions
- **New principles**: Added 5 new product principles including "Teach, don't just build" and "Purpose over paths"

- **New OKRs**: Added Objectives 4 (product thinking) and 5 (learning progression)
