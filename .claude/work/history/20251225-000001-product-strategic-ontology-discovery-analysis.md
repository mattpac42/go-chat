# Product Strategic Session: Ontology + Discovery Analysis

**Date**: 2025-12-25
**Agent**: product-strategic
**Task**: Evaluate two strategic ideas - Ontology-Based Code Organization and Guided Product Discovery

## Work Completed

Comprehensive strategic analysis of two platform differentiation concepts:

1. **Synergy Analysis**: Documented how discovery outputs seed the ontology and how ontology validates discovery decisions

2. **User Journey Design**: Created 4-phase journey from "Idea" to "Working Code" (Discovery → Visual Planning → Guided Building → Understanding & Evolution)

3. **Ontology Viability Assessment**: Determined ontology is valuable for non-technical users IF presented as simple "App Map" view with progressive disclosure

4. **Competitive Positioning**: Mapped against Cursor, v0, Bolt, Replit, Lovable - identified unique position as "teaching + building" platform

5. **Risk Assessment**: Identified high risks (discovery fatigue, ontology complexity, over-engineering) with mitigations

6. **MVP Scope Definition**: Recommended phased approach:
   - Phase 1: 3-question discovery + auto-generated tree view (4-6 weeks)
   - Phase 2: Full discovery + graph view (4-6 weeks)
   - Phase 3: Systems coaching (4-6 weeks)

## Decisions Made

- **Discovery scope**: Keep to 5-10 minutes max to prevent fatigue
- **Ontology presentation**: Never show as editable ontology; always as read-only "App Map"
- **Naming strategy**: Avoid technical terms - "App Map" not "Ontology"
- **Competitive angle**: Position as "think before you build" + "see the whole picture"

## Key Recommendations

1. Validate discovery value with 5-10 user interviews
2. Prototype tree view for user testing
3. Define success metrics (completion rate, engagement, build quality)
4. Start with tree view, not graph view, for MVP simplicity

## Files Modified

- None (strategic analysis only)

## Artifacts Created

- Strategic analysis document delivered in chat
- User journey diagrams (ASCII)
- Competitive positioning matrix
- MVP phasing plan

## Next Steps

- User research to validate discovery value proposition
- Low-fidelity prototype of App Map tree view
- Technical spike on ontology auto-generation from code
