# UX Design Review Session: Toggle and Preview Panel Issues

**Date**: 2025-12-31T01:26:08Z
**Agent**: strategic-ux-ui-designer
**Task**: Review UX issues with Group/Timeline toggle and HTML Preview panel

## Work Completed

Analyzed the following components for UX issues:
- `/workspace/frontend/src/components/chat/BuildPhaseProgress.tsx` - Toggle implementation
- `/workspace/frontend/src/components/preview/ProjectPreview.tsx` - Preview component
- `/workspace/frontend/src/components/chat/ChatContainer.tsx` - Layout integration
- `/workspace/frontend/src/components/ProjectPageClient.tsx` - Right sidebar panel
- `/workspace/frontend/src/components/chat/MessageList.tsx` - Phased view consumer

## Issue 1: Group/Timeline Toggle Analysis

### Current Implementation
- Toggle button shows "Timeline" text when `showPhasedView` is TRUE (grouped view active)
- Toggle button shows "Group" text when `showPhasedView` is FALSE (timeline view active)
- Uses ListIcon for phased state, GridIcon for timeline state

### Root Cause of Confusion
The labels describe **what you will get** (action-oriented) rather than **what you are viewing** (state-oriented). This is backwards from user expectation. Users expect the active option to show the current state, not the action.

### Recommendations Provided
See detailed recommendations in Deliverables section below.

## Issue 2: Preview Panel Size Analysis

### Current Implementation
- Right sidebar is fixed at `lg:w-80` (320px)
- Preview renders in `flex-1 overflow-hidden` container
- No resize capability
- No expand/popout functionality
- Hidden on screens smaller than `lg` breakpoint

### Root Cause of Issue
320px is insufficient for meaningful HTML preview - typical web content is designed for 375px+ (mobile) or 768px+ (tablet). Users cannot effectively evaluate their work.

### Recommendations Provided
See detailed recommendations in Deliverables section below.

## Decisions Made

- Recommended segmented control over toggle for Issue 1 (higher discoverability)
- Recommended resizable panel + fullscreen modal for Issue 2 (progressive disclosure)
- Prioritized solutions by implementation complexity

## Files Reviewed

- `/workspace/frontend/src/components/chat/BuildPhaseProgress.tsx` - Contains toggle logic
- `/workspace/frontend/src/components/preview/ProjectPreview.tsx` - Simple iframe wrapper
- `/workspace/frontend/src/components/chat/ChatContainer.tsx` - Toggle state management
- `/workspace/frontend/src/components/ProjectPageClient.tsx` - Panel layout (320px fixed)
- `/workspace/frontend/src/components/chat/MessageList.tsx` - Consumes showPhasedView

## Recommendations

Detailed UX recommendations provided in response. Ready for tactical designer implementation.
