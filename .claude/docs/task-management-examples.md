# Task Management Examples

## Task Discovery Protocol Example

```
WHEN new requirements are discovered:
1. Immediately add subtask to capture the work
2. Update parent task with new scope if needed
3. Notify user of scope expansion
4. Continue with enhanced task list

EXAMPLE:
Original task: "Implement user login"
Discovered: Need password reset functionality
Action: Add subtask "Implement password reset flow"
```

## Right vs Wrong Task Completion

```
❌ WRONG: Complete 5 tasks then mark them all done
✅ RIGHT: Mark each task completed immediately upon finishing

❌ WRONG: Ignore new requirements discovered during work
✅ RIGHT: Add new subtasks to capture all work needed
```
