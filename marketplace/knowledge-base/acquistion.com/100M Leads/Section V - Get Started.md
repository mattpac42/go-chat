Section V: Get Started
“It’s not the end. It’s not even the beginning of the end. But it is,
perhaps, the end of the beginning”
-Winston Churchill
June 2017. Three months after we lost it all, again, and switched
Gym Launch to licensing.
“Hey Leila, what do you make of this?” I asked.
“What’s up?”
I gave her my phone.
Mr. and Mrs. Hormozi, we cordially invite you to a private event
for entrepreneurs earning eight figures and up. Let me know if
you’re interested.
“Seems cool” she said. “...but we’re not making eight figures?”
I pretended not to hear her. “You wanna go?”
“Sure. Is it included in our mentorship dues?”
“One sec, I’ll ask”
An email response came a moment later:
No, this is an additional fee. It is a two-day event limited to ten
people at a private resort.
“Nope” I said.
“Huh. Can we afford to go?” Ouch.
“Who cares? We can’t afford not to go.”
10 days, a long flight, and a short drive later…
We made it. The “cool kids” meet up. I had one goal, to add as
much value as I could to everyone else in the room. But the
moment I walked in, I knew I was out of my league. I recognized
almost everyone there. They were famous in the advertising world.
They all spoke at huge events. Signed autographs. Made millions.
Then, there was me. I wasn’t an eight-figure entrepreneur. I was a
kid from Baltimore just paying to breathe everyone else’s air.
Once everyone settled we had a short housekeeping discussion and
then got down to business. This way of doing things was a sharp
contrast to the big stages, booming sound systems, flashing lights,
and other theatrics that “real” events have.
The first speaker was ready to go. He had a ‘man bun’ and loose
yoga-ish clothing. He looked like a hippie. But then, he opened
with how he was only doing $3,000,000 per month…is this for
real!? I felt like a fraud. The numbers he shared with such a casual
attitude blew my mind. How is this possible?
He continued on with his talk using all sorts of business,
advertising, and tech jargon. He pointed to dizzying charts and
graphs. I came here to learn more about advertising but felt dumber
by the second. I recognized enough of the words to realize I knew
nothing useful about them. His presentation went way over my
head. I started sweating bullets. Leila grabbed my hand. We both
felt stressed and out of our depths.
He finished and finally opened up for Q&A. Excellent. But the
questions were still at the same level as his presentation. Nope, I’m
still doomed. Then, an awkward voice cracked.“So uhh… What
courses are you taking to learn all this stuff?” Now we’re talking. I
leaned in. Pen in hand. His answer changed my life:
“At this point, I don’t expect to learn anything new from courses. I
have to learn by doing. And I ‘do’ by spending a percentage of my
revenue to test new campaigns, new channels, new pages, or just
plain crazy ideas. And I learn something every time I test, so the
money is well spent. Whenever one of these tests is a winner, and
some are, it’s a big deal. I learn something amazing and make far
more money than I spent. It raises the bar for my business and,
more importantly, myself. So whether it's 1%, 5%, or 10%, set
some percentage of your advertising budget aside to try new things
without expecting a return. Consider it an investment in your
education.”
I felt chills go through me like some judgment demon left my
body. He gave me permission to fail.
None of this is magic. If he can do this, so can I.
***
The next week, I tripled my advertising budget. Yes, it was a bit
aggressive. But my mindset had completely changed. I’d either
make more, or get better:
Our business went from $400,000 in June to $780,000 in July.
From there, my cost to get customers went up too high. So I tried
new audiences. Most failed. Then, a hit. Boom, we cruised past
$1M to $1.2M to $1.5M per month.
Then, I realized we didn’t follow up with our engaged leads… at
all. We tested email. Didn’t work. We tested phone calls. Nothin’.
Then I tried text blasts. Wham, we zoomed to $1.8M the next
month.
From there, we tested paid ads like crazy. We made way more of
them and put more focus on their production value. Boom. We
cruised past $2.5M per month.
Then, we launched our affiliate program and stacked another
$1.5M per month on top. That took us past $4m per month. Years
later, our portfolio now does more than $16,000,000 per month.
So test until you find something that works. Take massive action.
Stay focused. Double down on it until it breaks. Then test until you
find the next thing that works, and double down on that. Taking
these leaps are the only way to unlock the business you want and
the life that comes with it. And maybe, slay your judgment demon
too.
So from now on…
You either win or you learn.
The End of the Beginning
Your speed to making big money depends on how fast you learn
the skills to making big money. Getting more engaged leads with
the skills of advertising, is a great start to making more money. In
fact, if you make any amount of money, more engaged leads will
make you even more. And, sadly, those skills take time to learn. So
I share my experiences to shave years off your time. To shorten the
gap between no money and mo’ money. It’s time to make it
happen.
Outline Of The “Get Started” Section
This final section has three chapters. They are short and sweet, just
like our time together.
In the first chapter, Advertising in real life– I’ll lay out my one big
advertising rule. Then, I’ll give you my personal one-page
advertising plan you can use to get more engaged leads, today.
In the next chapter, Putting It all Together– I’ll lay out the roadmap
to scale from your first few leads all the way to your $100M Leads
machine.
Finally, A Decade In Page–I’ll distill everything we learned into
bullets to show how far we’ve come in our time together. Then, to
send you on your way, I’ll share a parable that has gotten me
through even my hardest times.
Advertising in Real Life: Open To Goal
If some is good, more is better.
June 2014.
When I launched my first gym, I used the same paid ads I used at
Sam’s gym from way back. And they worked, for a while. Over
time, the costs started creeping up. I got less leads for the same
money. But, I still needed more customers. I wasn’t sure what to
do.
I talked to a mentor who ran a chain of tanning salons for some
advice. He said “before all this fancy internet stuff, flyers crushed
for us, you should try those.” So, try them we did. We printed 300.
Over the next day, we put them on cars in areas close to the gym.
A day passed. Nothing. The next day, the phone rang. Finally!
“Hey, you put a flyer on my car–” My heart raced. It worked!
“–Yes, yes I did! How can I–?” But before I could finish, he
interrupted right back.
“–yea, you scratched my Mercedes…” Crap. “...you’re gonna need
to pay for–” I panicked and hung up the phone. He called back. I
let it ring. He never called again. That was the only call I got from
the flyers. No leads. Nothing.
Universe: 1. Alex: 0.
A few weeks later
I sat in the lobby of my gym waiting for customers to fall into my
lap. Feeling bored, and a bit frustrated, I called the mentor with the
‘bright idea’ to put out flyers.
“Hey Alex - how's it going?”
“Uh, not too good.”
“Why what's up?”
“We put out the flyers like you said.”
“Oh yea, how many leads you get from ‘em?”
“None.”
“Hmm…that’s odd.” He paused. “What was your test size?”
“What do you mean?”
“You know, how many did you put out?”
“I put out 300.” I said in a resentful tone.
“Shoot, you only put out 300? Hard to know if anything works
with such a small number…I test with 5000. Then when we find a
winner, we put out 5000 per day, every day, for a month…”
Five thousand? He tests with almost seventeen times more than my
entire “campaign.” And he does it in a single day. I felt like the
person who says exercise doesn’t work after going to the gym one
time. And I hate that person.
“...I mean what kind of response did you think you were gonna
get?” he chuckled. “If we get half a percent, that’s decent. If we get
one percent, that’s a winner. With 300 flyers, half a percent would
be like one and a half people. That makes it pretty hard to know if
you got a winner or not.”
I had nothing to say. He was right. I felt like a fool.
I doubt he remembers the call. But, it stuck with me. I promised
myself I would never let effort be the reason anything didn't work
for me. It could be something else. The offer. The copy. The image.
The targeting. The media. The platform. The position of the moon.
But not. my. effort.
Those 300 measly flyers taught me a mondo lesson. I did the right
stuff, but I didn't do it enough times. I lacked what can be
described in a single word: volume.
Neil Strauss once said “Success comes down to doing the obvious
thing for an uncommonly long period of time without convincing
yourself you’re smarter than you are.” The right action in the
wrong amount still fails. Most people, myself included, stop too
soon. We don’t do enough.
Most people dramatically underestimate the volume it takes to
make advertising work. They're not doing half as much or a third
as much as is required. In fact, they're doing dramatically less. I
was doing 1/1500th the level of effort required to make a flyer
campaign work–I just didn't know it.
I hear this all the time. “Alex, I reached out to 100 people over the
last six weeks, I only got one customer, it doesn’t work.”
Response: “You did 1/42 of the amount of work required. It was
100 per day, not 100 over time.”
Most people do not get that advertising is an inputs and outputs
game. To them, outputs appear out of their control. Their low effort
inputs get them their low and unreliable output of engaged leads.
We’re ending that now. You input advertising effort. Your output is
engaged leads. Period. Now, we are crystal clear on the stuff you
do (the core four). And like we learned when maximizing the core
four–You just gotta put in more and do it better than before. We
started with the rule of 100–but when you make that the norm,
you’re ready to take it to the next level with…
Rule of 100 on Steroids–Open To Goal
A very successful gym chain allowed their sales managers to make
their own schedules. But there was a catch–they had to sign up five
new members per day no matter what. So if they did it by lunch,
they could cut out early. But if it took 18 hours, so be it. They
called this type of work schedule ‘open-to-goal’.
I’ve found that elite entrepreneurs and salespeople across
industries do some variation of ‘open to goal’. This is because it’s
like the rule of 100… but for the big kids. You don’t just commit to
doing something a specific number of times… you commit to the
work until you hit a specific number of outcomes–no matter what.
So it means you unlock a whole new level of effort you never even
realized you had. It might mean only doing something fifty times
to get the desired result. Or, like the flyers, five thousand times,
every day, for years.
If you want to take your advertising to the next level - work until
the job is done. Give up the idea of ‘doing your best.’ Instead, do
what is required. And sometimes that means your best just needs to
get better.
How I Make Open To Goal Work For Myself
If I had to pick the three habits that best served me in my life - they
would be:
1) Waking up early (4-5 am)–Pro tip, this actually means going to
bed early…
2) Getting right to work–No rituals. No routines. I drink coffee and
get to work.
3) No meetings until noon–No interruptions. Nothing. Fully
focused work time.
To be clear, I don’t think there’s any magic to waking up early. But
I do think there’s magic in a long stretch of uninterrupted work
immediately after a long stretch uninterrupted sleep. After all, it’s
the most productive hours in a row of the most productive work I
can do… with nothing getting in my way… Every. Single. Day.
How can you lose?
And since I have a good idea of what I can do in a day, I set my
daily goal accordingly. Then, only after my dedicated block of
work–do I go put out fires, talk to humans, and deal with the other
day to day stuff.
Waking up early, getting right to work, and working 8 hours
straight has been my highest ROI “habit stack.” By a longshot. If
you choose to try it, I hope it serves you as well as it has served me
(or better). And for those of you thinking “Wait! That’s more than
twelve hours of work a day!” You’re right. I’m playing to win. But
if it overwhelms you at first, I get it. Just throttle it back a few
hours and then work your way up. Some days it’s tough, but I
always like to remind myself:
“Do more than they do, and you will have more than they have.”
Since my job is usually to “get more customers” in most of my
companies, advertising is what I focus on. This book, for example,
was written exclusively in that open to goal time block. Why?
Because it’s an asset that can bring me more companies.
So, if you’re gonna follow my high ROI habit stack, then you’re
gonna want a clear action plan for that time. This is the simplest
advertising plan I can give you.
One Page Advertising Checklist
Step #1: Pick The Type Of Engaged Lead To Get: Customers,
Affiliates, Employees, or Agencies
Step #2: Pick Rule of 100 or Open To Goal. Commit To Your
Daily Advertising Actions
Step #3: Fill Out The Advertising Checklist For That Daily Action
Step #4: Do this daily action until you have enough money to
afford paying someone else to do it.
Step #5: When you do, go back to step 1. Make employees your
new target lead type. And repeat steps 1-4 until you have the help
you need. Then, scale again.
Conclusion
Lots of pages. So many ideas. We’re almost at the end. But, you
don’t have any more leads. What gives? Answer: Reading doesn’t
get people interested in the stuff you sell… advertising does. If
you’re not telling anyone about the stuff you sell, then you aren’t
getting anyone interested in the stuff you sell. Period.
This chapter laid out the plan to advertise in the simplest way I
could:
Work ‘open to goal.’
Structure your day to make open to goal possible.
Create and commit to that goal with the one page advertising
checklist.
Many skip planning, or worse, they write a one hundred page plan
that never gets used. So skip the atrocious waste of time that is
writing pages of baloney. Harness the power of laying out your
action steps on a single page. It leaves little room for excuses,
distractions, and delusions. You either did the stuff or you didn’t.
You can fill out your one page advertising checklist in about five
minutes. And once the naked truth stares back at you, all you have
left is to do it.
The Roadmap - Putting it All Together
Zero to $100,000,000
“A leader must aim high, see big, judge widely, thus setting himself
apart from the ordinary people who debate in narrow confines.”
- Charles de Gaulle,
French President During World War II
To get to where you want to go, it pays to know what lies ahead.
So in this chapter, I describe the phases you will go through as you
scale your advertising. Acquisition.com uses this roadmap to scale
our portfolio companies from a few million a year, all the way to
$100,000,000+. These levels will help you identify where you are
on the advertising totem pole so you know what to do to get to the
next level.
Level 1: Your friends know about the stuff you sell. To start getting
engaged leads, you make one offer, to one avatar, on one platform.
The moment you get engaged leads, is the moment you can start
making money. For me, this started with reaching out to everyone I
knew.
Primary Action: Warm outreach.
Level 2: You consistently let everyone you know about the stuff you
sell. You know the exact inputs to get an engaged lead with your
chosen advertising method. And, by scaling those inputs, you get
consistent customers with it. But the consistent customers come
from maximizing your personal work capacity. For me, on top of
warm reach outs, I maximized my personal work capacity with
paid aids, using a case study as my lead magnet. But looking back,
I wish I would have started with posting free content. So I suggest
that.
Primary Actions: Do as much warm outreach and post as much
content as you can consistently.
Level 3: You get employees to help you do more advertising.
You’ve maxed your personal advertising inputs, but not the
platform. And if you want more engaged leads that can only mean
one thing. Doing more. For me, I hired a videographer and a media
buyer to take most of the paid ads work off my plate.
Primary Action: You hire people to advertise profitably on your
behalf.
Level 4: Your product is good enough to get consistent referrals.
You continue building goodwill and shoot for getting 25% or more
of your customers from referrals. Now, you’ve set yourself up to
ramp your advertising again. But to make that work, you have to
get more serious about hiring a team to make it happen.
This is when I realized that my ads were shut off but I was still
getting referrals every week. So, I doubled down on referrals. I
built goodwill using customer feedback to update my product
every two weeks. I also started a strong referral program with big
incentives at the same time.
Primary Actions: Focus on your product until you get consistent
referrals then go back to scaling your advertising with a bigger
team. This is where most people mess up. They let their product
slip and never recover.
Level 5: You advertise in more places in more ways with more
people. First, you expand to new audiences on your best platform.
Then, you make ads with all placements and media types the
platform supports. And, after your team can get consistent results,
you expand your team again to add: another platform, lead-getter,
or core four activity.
For me, I hit two birds with one stone. I expanded my paid ads to
include potential affiliates. And this paved the way for my affiliate
programs.
Primary Action: Advertise profitably using at least two methods on
multiple platforms.
Level 6: You hire killers. Your executives grow departments
specific to an advertising method or platform without you. And
you're not looking for potential. You're looking for experienced
leaders specializing in exactly what you want. We capped here.
It took me three years to figure out two things. One, that I needed
veteran executives with experience suited to my problems. And
two, that they needed stronger incentives. But by the time I
realized this, I sold those companies. Once I started
Acquisition.com I realized the power of expanding the pie to get
more of the right people invested in winning. This is how we
crossed $100M+ then $200M+ in portfolio revenue and beyond.
Primary Action: Get battle-hardened executives and department
heads to take over new advertising activities and channels.
Level 7: I’ll come back and edit this chapter once I cross a billion.
I promise, I’ll send the lessons as soon as I have them. You have
my word.
Last Points: I know this looks clean. But it never is. Real business
is messy. It takes a lot to find what audiences, lead magnets,
methods, and platforms work best. And you can only find out what
works if you try. So you have to try a lot of different things, a lot of
different ways, for a long enough time to know for sure.
Nobody can ever know the absolute best thing to do. But I do know
this: the more you advertise, the more people find out about the
stuff you sell. The more people who know about the stuff you sell,
the more people will buy it. This is the key to the $100M Leads
Machine.
The $100M+ Lead Machine
Let’s look into your future. Your business makes $100,000,000+
annual revenue. It’s great to have a clear picture of what the
$100M machine looks like. Let’s have a look, shall we? First and
foremost, your advertising fires on all cylinders…
Your media team scales tons of free content, in all media types,
on many platforms.
You regularly make offers to your warm audience to get more
customers or affiliates.
Your ravenous audience makes anything you launch immediately
profitable.
You have teams running and scaling profitable paid ads across
multiple platforms.
Your cold outreach team gets you more customers.
You have an affiliate manager launching and integrating all new
affiliates.
You have recruiters and recruiting agencies bringing in more
lead getters.
Your product is so good that a third of your customers bring you
more customers.
Your executive team drives all this growth without you.
And…you have more engaged leads than you can possibly
handle.
How long does this take? For business owners who know what to
do–anywhere from five to ten years. Building something great,
even if you know exactly what to do, takes time. And so many like
to trumpet “overnight success,” but looking behind the curtain tells
a different story. It took my wife and I more than ten years of our
best effort, to cross the first $100M in net worth. So the bigger
your goals, the longer your time horizons need to be. You want to
play games where if you wait, you win.

A Decade in a Page
“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication” - Leonardo Da Vinci
We’ve covered a lot. And I think organizing what we learned into
one place helps it sink in. So I made this “back of the napkin” list
of what we’ve covered and why.
1) How to define a lead from this point forward. Now you know
what you’re after: engaged leads, not just leads.
2) How to turn leads into engaged leads with an offer or lead
magnet. And, how to make them.
3) The Core Four - the only four ways we can let people know
about the stuff we sell.
a) How to reach out to people who know us: ask them if
they know anybody
b) How to post publicly: hook, retain, reward. Give until
they ask.
c) How to reach out to strangers: lists, personalization, big
fast value, volume
d) How to run paid ads to strangers: targeting, callouts,
What-Who-Whens, CTAs, client financed acquisition
4) Maximizing the Core Four: More Better New
a) What keeps us from doing what I’m currently doing at
ten times the volume? Then solving for that.
b) Finding the constraint in our advertising. Then testing
until it frees the constraint. Then doing more until it gets
constrained again.
5) The Four Lead Getters: Customers, Employees, Agencies, and
Affiliates
a) How to get customers to refer other customers
b) How to get employees to scale your advertising without
you
c) How to get an agency to teach you new skills
d) How to get affiliates launched and integrated
6) When advertising in the real world: The Rule of 100 and Open to
Goal
a) The five step one-page advertising plan to get more
leads today.
7) The seven levels of advertisers and the $100M leads machine in
action.
As I promised in the beginning, the result of these bullets is more,
better, cheaper, reliable engaged leads. I hope this book provides
you utility. I hope as a result of reading this you know how to get
more leads than you currently are. And I hope I unmasked the
mystery behind lead getting.
Also, since you are one of the few who actually finish what you
start, I want to leave you with a parting gift: a fable that has gotten
me through my hardest times.
The Many Sided Die
Imagine you and a friend play a dice-rolling game. You are each
given one die. One of the die has 20 sides. The other has 200. On
each die, only one side is green. And the rest, are red.
The point of the game is simple: Roll green as many times as you
can.
The rules of the game are as follows:
You can’t see how many sides you have. You can only see if you
roll red or green.
If you roll green–One of your red sides turns green, and you get
to roll again.
If you roll red–Nothing happens, and you get to roll again.
The game ends when you stop rolling. And if you stop rolling,
you lose.
What do you do?
You roll. When you roll red, you pick up the die and roll again.
When others roll green, you pick up your die and roll again. When
you roll green, you pick up the die and roll again. You keep telling
yourself one thing. “The more I roll, the more greens I get.” At
first, you roll green once in a while. But as more red sides turn
green, the greens happen more. With enough rolls, hitting green
becomes the rule rather than the exception.
What does your friend do?
He rolls a few times and hits red each time. He sees you roll a
green and complains that you must have a die with fewer sides. He
reasons, it’s the only way you could have rolled green before him.
And although you did, you also rolled many more times. So which
is it?
In either case, he rolls a few more times in frustration and hits a
green. But then he complains about how long it took. He’s spent
more time watching you and complaining than actually playing.
Meanwhile, you’ve hit your green streak. It’s so much easier for
you, he tells himself. You get greens every time! This game is
rigged, so what’s the point? He quits.
***
So who got the die with 20 sides? Who got the die with 200 sides?
If you get the game then you see, once you roll enough times, the
die you’re given doesn’t matter.
Die with fewer sides might roll green sooner.
Die with more sides might roll green later.
But, a die with a green side always has a chance of rolling
green… if you roll it.
Every die hits its green streak when rolled enough times.
All of us get a many-sided die. And looking at the other players,
you have no idea if it’s their 100th roll or their 100,000th. You
don't know how “good” other players are when they start, you can
only see how well they do now. But, if you understand the game,
you also know it doesn’t matter.
A few begin playing early. Others begin much later. The rest sit on
the sidelines complaining about how lucky the players are. I guess
so, but they’re luckier because they play. And when they hit red,
which they do, they didn’t quit. They rolled again.
Learning to advertise is a lot like the game of the many sided die.
You do not know if it will work until you try. And when you start
advertising, you will probably hit red on your first rolls. But if you
try enough times you will hit green. And when it works, you have a
better chance of getting it to work again. The more you do it, the
easier it gets. You begin to understand the game. No matter how
many players there are or the number of sides on the die you’re
given, you start to see the only two guarantees:
1) The more times you roll, the better you get.
2) If you quit, you lose
So here’s my final promise:
You cannot lose if you do not quit.
Free Goodies: Calls To Action
If it’s free, it’s for me!
I’m gonna give you a bunch of free stuff in a second - so stay
tuned.
Dr. Kashey (my editor) and I spent over 3,500 hours on this book.
We wrote 650+ pages and 19 drafts with varying frames, themes,
and points of focus. But ultimately, the changes left only the most
distilled ‘need to knows’ inside. We went through 127 pages of
hand drawn models to carve out the few that made it into the book.
All that to say - I hope this work results in you growing the
business of your dreams.
When I look back on my life these books will be among the things
I am most proud of. I wouldn’t be able to write as fervently if I
didn’t think people would read it. And as much as I strive to be the
man who would work as hard if nobody cared, I am not there yet.
Your support and positivity make a difference for me. So thank you
from the bottom of my heart for allowing me to do the work I find
meaningful. I am forever grateful.
If you are new to #mozination, welcome. We believe in big
ambitions, and matching our ambitions with giving and patience.
And I have a personal goal in that spirit of giving: to die with
nothing left to give.
So if you’re still with me, thank you. I want to provide some more
goodies.
1) If you’re struggling to figure out who to sell to, I released a
chapter called “Your First Avatar” between this book and the
last. Think of it like a ‘single’ from a music album. You can get
it for free at Acquisition.com/avatar. Just pop in your email
and we’ll send it over.
2) If you’re struggling to figure out what to sell, you can go to
Amazon or wherever you buy books and search “Alex Hormozi”
and $100M Offers. It should get you on the right path. The
digital version is available for sale at the cheapest price that the
platform would let me make it and still list it as a book.
3) If you’re struggling with getting people to buy, my next book
will be on persuasion and sales. It may or may not be out by
the time you read this. It’ll either be called $100M Sales or
Persuasion. I haven’t decided yet. But if you search my name
you can look for any other books that may be out by the time
you read this.
4) If you want a job at Acquisition.com or in one of our portfolio
companies - we love hiring from #mozination. We love doing
this because we’ve found our best returns investing in great
people. Go to Acquisition.com/careers/open-jobs, and you can

portfolio.
5) If your company is over $1M in EBITDA (profit), we’d love
to invest in your business to help you scale. It brings so much
pleasure to know our portfolio companies have grown much
bigger and faster than mine because they avoided the mistakes I
made. If you want us to take a look under the hood and see if we
can help go to Acquisition.com. Sending your info is fast and
easy.
