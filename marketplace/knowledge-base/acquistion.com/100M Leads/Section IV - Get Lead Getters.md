Section IV: Get Lead Getters
Get people who get you more leads
“Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it,
and I shall move the world.” - Archimedes
Building A $100M Lead Machine Is All About Leverage
An old lady can lift a semi-truck with a long enough lever. The
strongest man in the world, without one, can’t. The length of the
lever determines how much someone can lift. This is leverage. We
can use the principle of leverage in advertising. Let me explain:
Someone with internet can send a message to millions of people at
once. Someone writing postcards by hand can’t. The internet
allows us to reach more people for the same time spent. So, it’s
higher leverage.
That means leverage boils down to how much we get for the time
we spend getting it. So we want to use higher leverage activities to
get what we want. More stuff we want. Less time getting it. Good.
And we want leads. Lots of leads.
Lead Getters Give You Leverage
People can find out about the stuff we sell from two sources. We
can let them know using the core four. Or, other people can let
them know using the core four. I call these other people lead
getters. When other people do it for us, we save time. That means
we get more engaged leads for less work. Leverage baby.
Imagine four scenarios:
Scenario #1: You are the lead getter. You do the core four all day
everyday by yourself. You get enough leads to pay the bills.
Work: HIGH Leads: LOW Leverage: LOW
Scenario #2: You get a lead getter. You get a lead getter to do the
core four on your behalf. Now, the lead getter brings enough leads
to pay the bills without you advertising. You work less than
scenario #1 and get the same number of leads.
Work: LOW. Leads: LOW. Leverage: HIGH.
Scenario #3: You get lots of lead getters. You spend all your time
getting other lead getters. Your leads go up every time you get
another one. You work all day everyday, but you get way more
leads than you did when it was just you. You work more than
scenario #2 but get way more leads.
Work: HIGH. Leads: HIGH. Leverage: HIGHER.
Scenario #4: You get a lead getter who gets lead getters. You
recruit somebody who recruits other people to advertise on your
behalf. They get more lead getters every month. You only had to
work to get the first lead getter once, but his leads continue
climbing without you working. You works less than scenario #3,
and you get more leads each and every month.
Work: LOW. Leads: HIGH. Leverage: HIGHEST.
Now you’ve got the makings of a $100M Leads machine.
Outline of The “Lead Getters” Section
The lead getters aren’t part of the “core four” because they’re not
things you do. You do not ‘do’ affiliates or ‘do’ customer referrals
or ‘do’ agencies or ‘do’ employees. But, you have to do the core
four to get them. They come from warm outreach, cold reach outs,
posting content, and running paid ads. And once you get them, they
do it for you.
So the core four stacks. One time to get them, and a second time
for when lead getters get engaged leads on your behalf. But it
doesn’t have to end there. In fact, it shouldn’t. The process repeats.
Lead getters can go get lead getters! So we do something once then
lead getters can do it forever.
But wait, I thought this book was about getting leads? So am I
trying to get leads? Or do I want lead getters? Answer: Yes. Lead
getters start out as leads, then get interested in the stuff you sell
and become engaged leads like anyone else. The difference is they
get other people interested in the stuff you sell, too! And ideally,
every lead becomes a lead getter.
The following chapters explain, in detail, how to get other people
to advertise for you. And, if you want to scale to $100M+, you
have to understand them:
#1 Customers- they buy your stuff then tell other people about it
to get you leads.
#2 Employees- people in your business that get you leads.
#3 Agencies- businesses with services that get you leads.
#4 Affiliates- businesses who tell their audiences about your stuff
to get you leads.
*All four lead getters let other people know about your stuff. In
other words, all four are higher leverage than you doing it on your
own.
Once you do understand the four lead getters, you can build a lead
getting machine for every company you start for the rest of your
life. I’ll break down how I use all four lead getters. How each is
different. How to work with them. When to use them. Best
practices. And how to measure your progress along the way. At the
end of this section, you will understand how to get other people to
bring you more leads than you can possibly imagine.
And since we already use the core four to get customers, let’s start
with something we can do right now–get those customers to refer
more customers.

#1 Customer Referrals - Word of Mouth
“The best source of new work, is the work on your desk” - Charlie
Munger
October 2019.
Leila and I sat together on her parents’ living room couch. The one
she watched movies on as a kid. The faded edges of the coffee
table begged us to kick our feet up. We balanced laptops on our
thighs. Extension cords snaked around the couch to outlets down
the hall. Her stepmother clanged in the kitchen. This was not a
work environment. But, we made due.
Two years earlier, I lost everything and met her parents on the
same weekend…
Hey dad, I met this guy on the internet. He lost everything and has
no money. But don’t worry, I quit my job and moved in with him to
help with his next big business idea. By the way, can we crash here
for a while?’
…Great first impression, Alex.
But a lot had changed since then. We were multi-millionaires now.
We made enough to buy her childhood home in cash. Every week.
Leila reviewed reports from our department heads. Oh yeah, we
had executives now, too.
“Hey, sales numbers look a little soft this week.” she said.
“Really? How many did we close?”
“Fifteen. And sales started dipping last week too. Is there anything
different on your end?”
“I don't know. Let me check.” I logged into Facebook’s advertising
portal. Red rejection notifications filled the screen.
“Welp. That’ll do it” I said.
“What? What happened?”
“All the ads got shut off.”
“Well…that’s a problem. When do you think you can get them
back up?”
“It’ll take a day or two to get a new campaign started.”
I squinted at the screen. Something even more alarming jumped at
me. Facebook rejected the ads two weeks ago. I acted like nothing
was wrong.
“So we closed 15 this week, and how many the week before?” I
asked.
“21”
“Well, I’ve got good news and I’ve got bad news.”
“Uhh…Ok…”
“The bad news is…the ads got shut off two weeks ago, so that
explains the dip. The good news is…our product is so good that
we’re still doing $500,000 a week from word of mouth alone.
“You ignored the ads for two weeks!?” She had oh no you didn’t
written all over her face.
I shrugged with a sheepish grin. “You still love me, right?”
We busted out laughing at the absurdity of it all.
Those two years were insane. The amount of money we were
making didn't make sense. We didn’t comprehend how much until
years later. We were just grateful to be doing this together, flaws
and all. And this accidental stretch without running paid ads made
something very clear: Our customers were telling their friends.
**A few months later**
I stood on stage and looked out over the 700+ gym owner
audience. Everyone paid $42,000 to be there. All wore black “Gym
Lord” t-shirts and stick-on mustaches. It. Was. Nuts.
I was mid-presentation, explaining how excellent service generates
leads through word of mouth. All the while, I obsessed over
whether the money we made during two weeks without running
paid ads was a fluke. Feeling confident, I paused the presentation.
Time to find out:
“Alright, just to show you how important this is, who here learned
about Gym Launch from another gym owner? Raise your hand.”
As soon as the words left my lips, I felt instant regret. What if no
one raises their hand? What if our growth was all forced? I’m such
an idiot.
I looked around the room with my arm raised like a monkey. The
room stood still. Oh no.
Then…a few gym owners raised their hands. That doesn’t look
great, but it could be worse. Then, more. Thank God. Then, more.
Then, a wave of hands. Holy cow. People looked to their sides and
behind them. It was almost the entire room. I let the moment sink
in for all of us. I’ll never forget it. I knew we had good word of
mouth, but not this good.
“That” I said, “is the power of word of mouth.”
***
I know you weren’t there when Leila and I realized we were
making $500,000+ per week from word of mouth. I know you
weren’t there to see $30M in customers say someone referred
them. The first time I realized the power of referrals - it was by
accident. Seeing how much it made me, I studied what had gone
right. I wanted to make sure I could recreate it on purpose. For me
to transfer that ability to you, I have to transfer the beliefs that
created it. And these experiences formed those beliefs. This is why
I share them.
People copied our offers, ads, and lead magnets. They copied our
landing pages, emails, and sales scripts. They copied everything
they could–but they did it with little success. They think it’s about
"advertising," and it is. But the best advertising is a happy
customer. An amazing product turns every customer into a lead
getter.
The world loses trust by the second. Every day, more customers do
their research. They arm themselves with information to make
purchasing decisions. As well they should. So to play at higher
levels, we need our product to not only deliver... but delight.
Customers must get so much value it compels them to tell other
people about us. The good news is, once you know how, it’s easier
than you think.
In this chapter, I explain how to get the lowest cost, highest profit,
and best quality leads out there: referrals.
How Referrals Work
A referral happens when somebody, a referrer, sends an engaged
lead to your business. Anyone can refer, but the best referrals come
from your customers. So this chapter focuses on getting more
referrals from your customers.
How Referrals Grow Your Business
Referrals are important because they grow your business in two
ways:
1. They’re worth more (higher LTGP). Referrals buy more
expensive stuff and buy it more times. They also tend to pay in
cash upfront. Lovely.
2. They cost less (lower CAC). If one customer sends you another
customer because they like your stuff, that new customer costs
you nothing. And free customers are cheaper than customers that
cost money. So free customers = good.
But what does this stuff really mean? Check this out…imagine you
had an LTGP to CAC ratio of 4 to 1. That means it costs twentyfive
percent of your lifetime gross profit of one customer to get
another. Not bad. But now imagine if every customer brought you
two more customers. You’d now have an LTGP to CAC ratio of 12
to 1– you’d use just over 8.3% of your lifetime gross profit to get a
new customer. So you get three customers for the price of one.
Now we’re talking. Hooray. What a deal! On top of that, referrals
are exponential. Let me explain.
The number of engaged leads you get from the core four depends
on how much you do them. The inputs to outputs have pretty linear
relationships. If you do 100 reach outs you get engaged leads. If
you double it, your leads roughly double. If you spend $100 on
ads, you get engaged leads. If you double it, your leads roughly
double. So no matter how well you advertise, how much you get
depends on how much you do. And that’s great. But with word of
mouth, we can do even better. With word of mouth, one customer
brings two. Two bring four. Four bring eight. And so forth. It’s not
linear, it’s exponential.
Nothing scales like word of mouth. Want to know why so few
people scale by word of mouth? They lose customers faster than
they get them. Look at the referral growth equation to see it in
action. Referrals (in) minus churned customers (out).
If referrals are greater than churn: you grow without any other
advertising (yay!)
If referrals are equal to churn: you need other advertising to
grow your business (meh)
If referrals are less than churn: you’ve got to advertise to break
even (boo - most folks)
This gets nutty when you look at percentages. If the percentage of
referrals every month is bigger than the percentage of customers
who leave, your business compounds every month. You’d have to
spend that much more money on ads, do that many more reach
outs, or post that much more content just to maintain that growth.
You eventually hit a wall. But with referrals, you can maintain
growth no matter how big you get. This is how companies like
PayPal and Dropbox exploded into multibillion dollar businesses.
I’ll break down their exact strategies later in the chapter.
On the other hand, small businesses barely scrape by because they
have about the same customers exiting as they do entering. A
hamster wheel of death. Here’s why…
Two Reasons Most Businesses Don’t Get Referrals
Most businesses don’t get referrals for two reasons. First, their
product isn’t as good as they think it is. Second, they don’t ask for
them.
Problem #1: The Product Isn’t Good Enough
“Everyone loves our stuff, we just need to get the word out!” - says
every small business owner with a product that’s not as good as
they think it is.
I’m gonna take off my nice guy hat for a second. If your product
were exceptional, people would already know about it and you’d
have more business than you could handle. So if you sell direct to
consumers and they are not bringing you more customers, your
product has room to improve.
I like to ask myself: “Why are my customers too embarrassed to
tell everyone they know about my product?” It may be okay, but
it’s unremarkable, as in - not worthy of remark.
In fact, most of the stuff I pay for, kind of sucks. My pool guy
forgets stuff half the time. My landscapers make tons of noise at
the worst hours. My cleaners routinely put my clothes in my wife's
closet (I guess that’s what I get for extra schmedium t-shirts). The
list goes on.
Business owners wonder why they don’t get referrals. The answer
is right in front of them. They're just not good enough. Let me
show you how I think about it:
Price is what you charge. Value is what they get. The difference
between price and value is goodwill.
This means that price not only communicates value, but it’s also
how we judge value. Economics dorks call it ‘customer surplus’.
But I’m just gonna call it goodwill. You want lots of goodwill. Lots
of goodwill creates word of mouth. Word of mouth means
referrals.
There are two ways to build goodwill with your customers. You
can lower your price or you can give more value. After all, if you
lower the price of your product enough, people would line up to
get it. But you’d probably lose money. So, lowering the price is, at
best, a temporary solution. You can only lower the price so much
for so long. And, as marketing legend Rory Sutherland says, “Any
fool can sell something for less.”
So, to build goodwill to get referrals, the question isn’t how do we
lower our price but, how do we give more value?
Six Ways To Get More Referrals By Giving More Value
There are six ways I get referrals by giving more value. And it just
so happens to map to the parts of an ad. Neat-o.
1. Call Outs → Sell Better Customers
2. Dream Outcome → Set Better Expectations
3. Increase Perceived Likelihood of Achievement → Get More
People Better Results
4. Decrease Time Delay → Get Faster Results
5. Decrease Effort and Sacrifice → Keep Making Your Stuff Better
6. Call to Action → Tell Them What To Buy Next
1. Call outs → Sell Better Customers. We want to sell better customers
because they get the most value from our products. Customers that get
the most value have the most goodwill. And the customers that have
the most goodwill are most likely to refer. Yes, it’s that simple. Let me
give you a real-life example:
We have a portfolio company that did public relations for generic
small businesses. They had a lot of sales, but they had a lot of churn.
So they plateaued. They didn’t grow for years.
To see what we could do, we looked at their lowest churning
customers to see if they had anything in common - they did. They
were all in a specific niche and looking to raise funding from
investors. So the solution looked obvious–get more of them! But the
founder had a big worry–these customers were only fifteen percent of
his business. If he changed his targeting, and it failed, he would lose
eighty-five percent of his business(!). But the business wasn’t growing
anyway. A tough situation for any entrepreneur. But, after reviewing
the data many times, he agreed to change the advertising call outs to
match this narrower, “perfect fit” customer.
The results: The company broke through its plateau. They grew for
the first time in years - and now on track to adding millions per
month. Plus, their cost of advertising–a huge expense for their
stagnating business–went down. They got even cheaper leads since
they could be more specific with their messaging. But not only that,
the cheaper leads got even more value from the product because it was
meant for them. And those customers, because they had more
goodwill toward the business, started referring like clockwork.
Action Step: Increase the quality of the prospect, and you’ll increase
the quality of the product. Figure out what your most successful
customers have in common. Use those similarities to target a new
audience that has the greatest chance of getting the most value. Then,
sell only people who meet those new criteria. Set yourself up to build
more goodwill. More goodwill means more referrals.
2. Dream Outcome→Set Better Expectations: The fastest, easiest, and
cheapest way to make your product remarkable - make it better than
they expect. And that's easier than you might think because you set the
expectations.
Have you ever had a stranger tell you a new movie was awesome?
Then you go see it and think ‘that wasn’t as good as I expected.’ On
the flip side, have you ever had someone tell you a movie was terrible,
then you ended up seeing it anyways and thought ‘That wasn’t as bad
as I expected.’ Our expectations of an experience can dramatically
affect the experience itself. We can increase goodwill by lowering
expectations. It gives us room to overdeliver.
In the beginning, I promised everything and the kitchen sink to get
people to buy. Fulfilling on that turned into a nightmare. So, I began
inching down my promises while maintaining quality. It gave me
more room to overdeliver and I netted a major benefit - referrals.
Customer expectations are fickle. That’s why we set the expectations
for them. And if we set those expectations, then we can exceed them.
Action Step: Slowly lower the promises you make when making
offers. Keep lowering them until your close rates lower. At that point,
stop. This maximizes how many customers you get and the goodwill
you build with them. Maximized customers and more goodwill means
more referrals.
3. Increase Perceived Likelihood of Achievement → Get More
People Better Results:
The customers with the best results get the most value from your
product. Figure out what they do to get the most value, and you can
help your other customers do the same. Two steps ago, to sell better
customers, we figured out who the best ones were. So now, to get
everyone the best results, we figure out what the best ones did.
Let me show you what it looked like at Gym Launch. We started by
tracking customer activities. Speed to running their first paid ad.
Speed to their first sale. Their attendance on calls. Etc. Then, we
compared the activities of our average customers to the activities of
our best customers. We found out something huge. If a gym owner ran
paid ads and made a sale in the first seven days, their LTGP tripled.
Once we realized this, we focused on getting everyone to launch ads
and make sales in the first seven days. The results of our average
customers skyrocketed. More customers, more testimonials and more
referrals followed.
Here’s the process I use to get more people better results:
Step #1: Survey customers to find the ones who got the best results.
Step #2: Interview them to find out what they did differently.
Step #3: Look at the actions they had in common.
Step #4: Force new customers to repeat the actions that got the best
results.
Step #5: Measure the improvement in average customer results (speed
and outcome)
Step #6: Match the conditions of your guarantee to the actions that
get the best results to get more people to do them.
Action Steps: Figure out what the best people did. Then get everyone
to do it. Make your guarantees around the actions that create the most
success. More success. More goodwill. More referrals.
4. Decrease Time Delay→Make Faster Wins: I define a “win” as any
positive experience a customer has. Faster wins increase their
perception of speed, increase the likelihood they’ll stick, and increase
how much they trust you. Triple win. To make wins feel faster, we
give them wins more often.
Let’s imagine you have a product that takes a week to deliver. The
customer can get one win at the end of that week or win every day
with daily progress updates. Same amount of progress, seven times
the wins. On top of that, if someone said seven things would happen,
and all seven do, I trust them even more. Referring a friend is now
lower risk since seven promises were made, and all seven were kept.
Here’s five ways I make wins happen faster in the real world:
1. If I have seven small things to deliver, I deliver them at
shorter intervals rather than all at once.
2. Updates are wins. If it’s a bigger project, I share progress
updates as frequently as possible. You can never give
someone too much good news. And regular updates, progress
or not, is better than leaving your customers hanging.
3. Customers form their lasting impression of a business within
the first forty-eight hours after they buy. Force a good
impression. Force as many wins as you can in that window.
Set many expectations. Meet many expectations. Repeat.
4. They should always know the next time they’ll hear from
you. I got a slick saying from a public CEO friend of mine -
BAMFAM: Book-A-Meeting-From-A-Meeting. Again, never
leave a customer in no man’s land. They should always know
what happens…next.
5. Never expect customers to forgive you. Ever. So act like it.
For example, you can deliver early, but never late. I add fifty
percent to my timelines so I always deliver early. That makes
“on time” for me early for them.
Action step: Break down outcomes into the smallest possible
increment. Communicate as often as reasonable (even if there is no
progress, update them). Set timelines with breathing room. Deliver
early. More customer wins means more goodwill. And more goodwill
means more referrals.
5. Decrease Effort & Sacrifice → Keep Making Your Stuff Better: If
the customer does less stuff they hate to benefit from your product,
you’ve made it better. If the customer gives up fewer things they love
to benefit from your product, you’ve made it better. And there’s no
such thing as a perfect product. You can always make it better. And
the easier you make it for them to benefit, the more goodwill you get,
and the more likely they’ll refer. Here’s my process to keep making
my stuff better.
Step #1:Use customer service data, surveys, and reviews to find
the most common problem with your product.
Step #2:Figure out your fix. To get a headstart, get feedback from
the customers who made your product work for them
despite the problem it has.
Step #3:Use that feedback to improve your product.
Step #4:Give the new version to a small group of your (struggling)
customers.
Step #5:Get your next round of feedback. If you solved the
original problem, then roll it out to all customers. If it
didn’t, go back to step #2.
Step #6:Move to the next most common problem and repeat the
process. Do this until the end of time.
Action Step: Keep making your stuff better. Survey. Make changes.
Implement. Measure. Repeat. I run this process every month. Set this
as a recurring monthly process. A product that takes less effort and
fewer sacrifices means more goodwill. And more goodwill means
more referrals.
6.Call To Action→ Tell Them What To Buy Next: If you have an
amazing product, they’ll want more. You have to satisfy their desire to
buy. If you don’t, they’ll still buy… but from someone else. Don’t let
that happen. Sell them again. You can either sell them a new thing or
more of the thing they just bought. In either case, you’ll get even
more goodwill and extend the lifetime of the customer. And besides,
the more stuff they can buy, the more stuff they can refer their friends
to.
For example, in a weight loss company we know, lots of customers
referred friends to their first tier product. But, some didn't. A lot of
those customers who didn't refer to the first product, when they
bought their more expensive thing, referred their friends to that! So
you gotta keep selling.
In my experience, people obsess over their front end offers. And that
makes sense. But then they neglect the back end and customers fall
off. And customers that fall off your product are unlikely to refer - so
keep selling them so they don’t.
Action Step: Treat every customer like it's the first time you've sold
them. Make sure your next offer is more compelling than your first.
Remind them to buy more after each big win. More things to buy
means more opportunities to add even more value. More value means
more goodwill. And more goodwill means, you guessed it, more
referrals.
One Question to Rule Them All
Let’s consolidate these six steps into one thought experiment. I
encourage you to try it out with your team. Here it is:
You’ve lost all your customers but one. The gods of advertising ban
you from doing the core four and decree:
-All customers must come from this one customer.
-Violate our terms and we will destroy your business, and every
other business you start, for eternity.
Tough break. But, the question remains, how would you treat this
customer? What would you do to make their experience so
valuable they would send all their friends? What kind of results
would they need to get? What would their onboarding be? What
type of customer would you pick? Think about it. Write it out. Your
business depends on it. Then…do it :)
Start acting like the advertising gods will revoke your core four
privileges at any moment. Soon you’ll see you have no choice but
to start adding more value to get more customer referrals.
Now that we covered that. Do you wanna know how you can get
even more referrals? →Ask for them.
Referrals: Ask For Them
Do you know why businesses have so few referrals compared to
what they could have? They never ask for them. Your customers,
like any audience, can only know what to do if you tell them.
Now, I’ve tried a lot of referral strategies. Most failed. And I
struggled until I had this epiphany: Asking for referrals only works
when you treat it like an offer. The referrals come when you show
the value the customer gets when they refer their friends. Let me
give you two quick case studies to show the power of asking for
referrals:
Case Study #1: Dropbox gave free storage to customers and free
storage to the friends they referred. The referral program went viral
and they 39 x'd their business in fifteen months.
Case Study #2: Paypal gave $10 in credit to customers and $10 to
the friends they referred. Within two years, the program helped
them reach a million users, and six years later, they hit 100 million
users. They still use it today.
So how do we harness the same viral growth in our own small
businesses? We do what they did. We ask for it.
Seven Ways To Ask For Referrals
There are three components to a referral program: how you give
the incentive, what you incentivize with, and how you ask. Rather
than give you a hundred variations that may or may not work, here
are the seven combos that worked best for me:
1) One-Sided Referral Benefit: I’d rather pay customers than a
platform any day of the week. Pay your average cost to acquire a
customer (CAC) to the referrer or the friend. Make them aware of
the incentive.
Ex: Imagine it costs $200 to get a new customer. Ask the current
customer to make an actual three-way introduction to a friend–via
call, SMS, or email. Not just a name and number. Also, ask them to
do it right when they buy…don’t wait. Then, write them a check
for $200 when their friend signs up OR give their friend $200 off.
Ex: This works great for spouses because they both basically get
the benefit. Always ask for the spouse & give a household
discount.
2) Two-Sided Referral Benefits: This is what Dropbox and PayPal
used. We pay our CAC to both parties. Half goes to the referrer (in
credit or cash) and half goes to the friend (in credit). This way, they
both benefit.
Ex: We sell $500 programs. Our cost to get a customer is $200. For
every friend someone refers, we give them $100 cash, and give
their friend $100 off signing up. Good for up to 3 friends. This
worked really well for my local businesses.
3)Ask For A Referral Right When They Buy: On the sales contract or
checkout page, ask for some names and phone numbers of people
they’d like to do this with. Show them how they will get better
results when they do it with a friend.
Ex: I had a new salesman come into one of my portfolio companies
and shatter all the sales records for an upcoming event. We didn’t
know what was going on. So I hopped on the phone with him - how
are you selling more tickets than everyone else? He shrugged and
said, “I’m doing the same thing as everyone else. I just make sure I
ask them who else they’d want to have come with them. Then ask
them to introduce me.” Half his sales were referrals. So simple, and
yet no one does it.
Scripting example: People who do our program with someone else
tend to get 3x the results. Who else could you do this program
with?
4)Add Referrals As A Negotiation Chip: On top of that, you can ask
for referrals as a way to negotiate a lower price. In other words, if
someone wants to pay $400 and your price is $500, you can give
them the discount in exchange for an introduction to three friends.
You can ethically charge a different price for the same thing
because you changed the terms of the sale.
Ex: “I can’t do anything less than $500 down, but if you make a 3-
way text introduction to a few of your friends right now, I’d be
happy to cut that initiation fee.”
And to address the question you didn’t ask - if a full-priced
customer finds out you gave someone else a discount (which I’ve
had happen), here’s all you say: “Yea - Stacy got $100 off because
she referred three friends. I'm happy to give you $100 if you refer
me three friends. Who do you have in mind?” They either back off
or they give you three friends. Win win.
5)Referral Events: Where people get points, credits, dollars or even
just bragging rights for bringing friends within an explicit time
period. Referral events typically last from one to four weeks.
Whenever you run one of these events, sell everyone on the
benefits of working with others. Use some stats (internal or
external) to show high success rates and the selfish benefit to
bringing friends. I use names like:
“Bring-a-friend” Promotion
“Spouse Challenge” Promotion
“Accountability Buddy” Promotion
“Coach Challenge” Promotion where you create teams with
your employees and customers. This works well in coaching
style businesses.
6)Ongoing Referral Programs: Instead of running a limited duration
referral promotion, you talk about the benefits of doing things with
others all the time. Think: in your free content, outreach, paid ads,
etc. After a buddy did this, he saw a 33% boost in total sign ups.
For context, he had 1,000,000 customers buy tickets to his virtual
event and 250,000 of them were referred…this stuff works.
7)Unlockable Referral Bonuses: Create bonuses for people who 1)
refer and 2) leave a testimonial. A few examples: Unlock VIP
bonuses, courses, tokens, status, training, merchandise, service
levels, premium support, additional hours of service, etc.
Unlockable referral bonuses work well if you don’t like paying out
cash. The bonuses can also be for both parties if you like (since
they cost you less than cash). Visit the lead magnet section for
some extra inspiration. As always, the more insane you make the
offer, the more people will refer. If you want them to refer, make it
so good they’d be stupid not to.
You’re Only Limited By Your Creativity
Here’s what it looks like to combine a few of the strategies above
into a killer referral promotion.
Give everyone a gift card for one-third the cost of their program.
Tell them they can give it to a friend of theirs if they sign up with
them. Give the gift card an expiration date within seven to fourteen
days from the date you give it to them→it’ll force them to use it.
This gives the referrer status when they give it to their friend.
Rather than saying “hey join my program for $2000 off” they say,
“I got this gift card for $2000. Do you want it? I don’t want to
waste it.” It’s seen as a much bigger deal for them and you.
You can still use the three-way introduction with this tactic. Then
text a picture of the gift card. Bonus points if you write the friend’s
name on it before texting the picture. It makes it feel personalized
and gives you a legitimate reason for asking for their friend’s name
(wink).
PS - You can also sell the gift cards at ninety percent off as
purchasable gifts (only for friends of customers). The referrer
looks like they spent a lot of money, and you get paid to get new
customers. I can hardly think of a better way to make money.
Again, the only limit is your creativity.
Conclusion
Referrals aren’t an advertising method you can “do.” It’s not one
trick or hack (although we learned some of those). It’s a way of
doing business. And it starts with you.
After all, referring is always a risk for the customer. They risk their
goodwill with their friend in the hopes of getting more by showing
them something cool (your stuff). So customers only refer when
they think it’s very likely their friend will have a good experience.
In other words, when the benefits to them personally outweigh the
risk of hurting the relationship with their friend. So we add benefits
for them and their friends with incentives and we lower the risk by
building goodwill (showing we deliver on our promises). And we
do that by using the six ways to give your customers more value.
Now don’t get me wrong, building goodwill does a fantastic job of
getting referrals on its own. But if we’re smart, which we are, we
capitalize on that goodwill, so we can get even more referrals, by
using the seven ways to ask for them. Whew!
So give more than you get and you’ll never go hungry again. This
is how we treat our customers. Do this, and you can monetize
goodwill forever. To keep this in perspective, I always remind
myself: I am compensated tomorrow for the value I provide today.
Action Items
Figure out your referral percentages and churn percentages to set a
baseline. Implement the six “giving value” steps to build goodwill.
Then capitalize on that goodwill, using one or more of the seven
ways to ask for referrals.
Next Up…
So now we have to figure out how to scale a team. It looks like
we’ll have to call out potential teammates, show them the value of
joining the team, then ask them to join. Wait… that sounds
familiar. But seriously, if you really want a $100M leads machine,
buckle up. The most valuable chapter in the book is coming up
next - employees. For real, this isn’t a boring chapter, and you’re
gonna need them if you wanna make the big money.
#2 Employees
“If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go
together” - African Proverb
June 2021.
The new sales director piped up, “I know we came in under our
goal again, but I don’t think we need to change anything, we’ll hit
it this quarter.”
Eyes darted around the room and looked in every direction but
mine. The silence was long enough for the executive assistant to
mark the topic covered and move on. No wonder we missed our
cold outreach goal for the second quarter in a row… nobody
challenged the failure. What, so now we think the third time's a
charm?
“Wait.” I said. Now everyone looked in my direction. “I’d like to
know why we didn’t hit this two quarters in a row. I know we can
sell–so if we want to make more sales with cold outreach, then we
do more cold outreach. What’s the issue?”
“We lose a rep every four weeks.” the sales director said. Aha.
“Ok…Why is our churn so high?”.
“I was wondering the same thing, but HR says we’re actually
below industry average churn for this position.” He continued,
“But, by the time we hire and onboard one, another churns out.”
I saw the HR director nodding in agreement. Getting warmer.
“OK, so the issue is hiring.” I said. “So, what’s the hiring situation
look like?”
“We hire one out of every four candidates HR pushes to us.”
“So if they churn out as fast as we hire them, and you only hire one
out of every four, that means you only get like one candidate a
week?”
“Yeah, about that” Almost there.
“Gotcha” Now I looked at the HR Director, “What’s the screening
situation look like?”
“We get one qualified candidate per ten screening interviews, give
or take.” She said.
“So it takes forty interviews to get a single, low-skill, frontline
worker?”
“I guess so.” Bingo.
“Alright, we need to change things up.” I said. “We're bottlenecked
at the one-on-one screening. Start interviewing in groups and look
for crazies there. Push everyone else with a good work ethic and
basic social skills over to sales. We can teach the rest. Agreed?”
The team nodded.
Within six weeks, hiring outpaced churn. Our cold outreach sales
increased in lockstep. By the end of the quarter, cold outreach sales
had doubled, and made up more than half our total sales.
The issue wasn’t our cold outreach method, skills, or offer at all.
We just didn’t have enough people doing cold outreach.

If you use the methods in this book, you will see more engaged
leads flow into your business. More engaged leads means more
customers. But as you grow, so does your workload. In due time, it
will take more work than any single person can handle. And you
can solve the problem of too much work for one person by having
more people work. In short, to advertise more, you’ll need more
workers. And this chapter will show you how employees work,
why they make you wealthy, how to get them, and the method I
use to turn them into lead-getters.
How Employees Work
Lead-getting employees are people working in your business that
you train to get you leads. They get you leads the exact same way
you got your own leads in the beginning. They can run ads, they
can make and post content, and they can do outreach. They can do
any advertising you train them to do. So more lead-getting
employees means more engaged leads for your business. It also
means less work you have to do to get the leads. More leads and
less work? Sign me up! But wait… Not so fast…
Don't get me wrong–-employees take work. They just take less
time and work than doing everything on your own. In my
experience, if you trade forty hours of doing for four hours of
managing, you work thirty-six hours less. Brilliant. And the best
part is, you can make that trade over and over. You can swap 200
hours of work per week for twenty hours of management. Then,
you trade the twenty hours of managing for a manager, who costs
you four hours per week to lead. What remains is four hours of
work for 200 hours of lead-getting. Boom.
Bottom Line: Employees make a fully functioning enterprise that
grows without you.
Why Employees Make You Wealthy
For your business to run without you, other people need to run it.
Scenario #1: Imagine you have a business that makes $5,000,000
per year in revenue and $2,000,000 in profit. And, to make that
profit, you have to work around the clock. In this situation, you
basically have a high paying job. But let’s say you're OK with
working all hours and knowing your business would burn down if
you took a vacation. Vacations are for losers anyways (kidding
*cough* sort of…). We still have another important thing to look
at…
Sure, you make a bit of money, but your business isn’t worth much.
If the business only makes money with you in it, then it’s a bad
investment for anyone else. That may not sound like a big deal
right now, but let’s consider an alternative.
Scenario #2: Your business makes the same $5,000,000 in revenue
and $2,000,000 in profit. But there’s one big difference: The
business runs without you. This does two very cool things. One, it
turns what used to be a risky job into a valuable asset. And two, it
makes you much wealthier. Here’s how:
First, you get your time back, so you can use that time to invest in
your business, buy other businesses, or take your stinkin’
vacations. Second, you become much wealthier because your
business is now worth something to someone else. You turned a
liability that relied on you into an asset you can rely on.
If you have an asset that makes millions of dollars without you then
that means somebody else could use it to make millions of dollars
without them. In other words, your business is now a good
investment. Then investors looking for assets, like Acquisition.com
for instance, would buy some or all of it from you. And your
$2,000,000 in profit per year, especially if it’s climbing, could
easily be worth $10,000,000+, right now. So your business went
from having almost zero value to having $10,000,000 of value. So,
learning how to get other people to do it for you makes a
$10,000,000 difference to your net worth. I’d say it’s worth
learning how to do it.
Reminder: You get rich from what you make. You become wealthy
from what you own. And it took me years to realize this because
not that long ago…
Everything I Thought I Knew About Employees Was Wrong
Have you ever heard…
If you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself.
No one can do it like I do it.
Nobody can replace me.
I have. I said all that stuff. I lived all that stuff. For years, every
time I hired somebody, I would compare what they could to what I
could do. In my head, I felt like it was “me against them.” To
somehow prove I was the more ‘able’ one. With my own team!
And this belief, this way of “leading” people, never made me more
money.
For business– “nobody can do it but me” and “if you want
something done right you gotta do it yourself” aren’t facts…
they’re false. Somebody did similar stuff before you were around.
And somebody will continue doing some version of it after you’re
gone. In one way or another–everyone is replaceable. It might be
by multiple people, technology, or later in time, but everyone can
be replaced. My suggestion: replace yourself as soon as you can.
Then, you can make yourself useful somewhere else. Many other
people figured this out. And so can you.
In the early days, whenever I started a business, I could do stuff
better than the people I hired. My entire workforce always ended
up looking like a ragtag group of misfits who could kind of do one
of the many things I could do. This got me up and running at first,
but I fell into the trap of believing I was better than everyone else.
I would go back and forth between gloating because I was better
than them and complaining because they weren’t as good as me.
And for whatever reason, it never occurred to me I was the one
who hired and trained them. Who was I kidding? The reality was
twofold: First, I didn’t have the skills to train or lead a team
properly. Second, I was too poor, and then (when I had a little
money) too cheap to hire anyone better. In other words, it was my
fault they sucked. Oops.
The more I tried to outcompete my employees, the more distracted
I became, and the worse my business got. Sure, at the time, maybe
I could do anything better than any of my employees. But… I
couldn’t do everything better than all my employees. And when I
finally realized this, I started adopting better beliefs about talent:
‘If you want it done right, get someone to spend all their time
doing it.’
‘If I can do it, someone else can do it better.’
‘Everyone is replaceable, especially me.’
These new beliefs about talent not only made a much healthier
culture in my businesses but also came with very profitable side
effects. Trusting my employees to succeed made my time and
attention far more valuable. If somebody else can do it, why would
I? If somebody else could train them, why would I? If I could learn
other stuff to grow the business while my team held the fort down,
it makes way more sense to do that. So let’s do that.
How To Get Employee Leads: The Internal Core Four
Remember the core four? Well, they work for getting employees
too. Imagine that. By changing the frame from “letting potential
customers know about your stuff” to “letting potential employees
know about your stuff” it immediately turns into something you
already know how to do. But some people also have the opposite
problem–they already know how to get employees just fine but still
struggle to get customers. Employees are just other people you let
know about your stuff. So you do the same thing!
Line up the actions to get employees with the actions to get
customers. It’s the same stuff!
Customers → Employees
Warm Outreach→Asking Your Network
Cold Outreach→ Recruiting
Post Content→Posting Job Openings
Paid Ads→Promoting Job Postings
Customer Referrals→Employee Referrals
Affiliates→ Associations, Guilds, Listservs etc.
Agencies→ Staffing firms etc.
Employees→Employees (unchanged)
The ways you get employee leads and their lead getters have
equivalents to the ways you get customer leads and their lead
getters. So when you need to get new talent, you just advertise to
get it. And when you need more, you do more. And like creating a
reliable process to get customers, you can also create a reliable
process of getting employees. And you’ll need both to scale.
How To Get Employees To Get You Leads
Now you hire someone who costs you money every month. Great.
Let’s make sure you make it back, and some ASAP.
Note–some people looking for work will already know how to get
leads. Those people are awesome. You can also count on them to
cost more. And if you’re starting out, you may not be able to afford
them. So, your next best option is to train them. Thankfully, you
have an entire book of lead-getting at your fingertips. So the next
step is training your employees on how you do those lead-getting
activities. I think about and actually approach training with this
3Ds mental model: document, demonstrate, duplicate. Here’s how
it works.
Step One - Document. You make a checklist. You already know
how to do the thing. Now you just need to write down the steps
exactly as you do it. You can also have other trusted observers
watch you and document what you do. Bonus points if you record
yourself doing the thing multiple ways and in multiple shifts. This
way, you can watch yourself as an observer rather than breaking
your flow by pausing to take notes while you go. Once you’ve got
everything put into the checklist, bust it out on your next work
block and only follow those steps. Can you do an A+ job only
following your directions exactly? If you can, you have the first
draft of your checklist for the job.
Step Two - Demonstrate: You do it in front of them. Just like your
parents taught you how to tie your shoes. You sit down and walk
them through the checklist step by step. This may take a while
depending on how many steps it takes to complete the thing. If
they stop you, or slow you down to understand something, adjust
your checklist for that. Now you have the second draft ready for
them to try.
Step Three - Duplicate: They do it in front of you. Now it’s their
turn. They follow the same checklist you followed. Except this
time, they’re the one doing, and you’re the one observing. We just
want them to duplicate what we did. So if the checklist is right, the
outcome will be the same. And if the checklist is off–you’ll find
out fast! Fix your checklist until it’s right. Then, have them follow
it until they get it right. And once they nail it, you now have a
bonafide lead-getter on your payroll. Congratulations!
After you train your first few employees this way, you’ll have
worked out the kinks for that job and it’s pretty smooth sailing
from there. At least the training part anyways. Think about it this
way, if you vanished tomorrow, could a stranger get the results you
get if they only followed your checklist? That’s the level of clarity
to shoot for.
Some helpful notes on training:
A helpful way to look at this training style is: If they get it wrong
or get confused then we got it wrong or made it confusing. If we
have to explain what a step means then the step is too
complicated. Or, more likely, we tried to put multiple steps into
one.
If they only appear to “get it” after a longish explanation or
multiple demonstrations then, again, we’ve got some work to do.
Business owners that ignore this run into chronic training
problems. And, word to the wise, you can probably force an
inferior checklist to work, but this turns into a nightmare when
somebody else takes over your training for you.
There is a difference between competence and performance. In
other words, they can know exactly what to do and not be that
good at it yet. If that’s the case, then your instructions are fine
and they just need practice. Using an analogy from the fitness
world–think “slow then smooth then fast.” You don’t need to
change anything, they just need more reps.
Focus on your employee’s ability to follow directions more than
whether they get the right result. This is super important because
if you train your employees to follow directions then… they will
follow directions. And, if they follow directions and get the
wrong result… then you know it’s the directions. That’s good.
You have a lot more control over that.
Everytime they do a step successfully–let them know they did it
right. And if they respond to praise, praise them! And if they
goof, that’s OK too. That’s what training is for. Don’t take over
for them when they mess up–simply pause, take a step back, and
let them try it again. Fast feedback cycles to get people to learn
faster.
If they follow your directions exactly and get the wrong result–
still praise them for following the directions. Praise them, then
make the corrections to your checklist on the spot.
Avoid punishment or penalties of any type for doing stuff wrong
during training. As a rule of thumb–reward the good stuff you
want them to do more of and they'll do more of it. Learning a
new skill is punishing enough, we don't need to add to it.
It’s hard to fix multiple things when you've never done
something before. Give feedback one step at a time. Give one
piece of feedback at a time. Practice until they get it right. Then,
move to the next step.
Whenever there is a major dip from normal performance, retrain
the team. They stopped doing an important step in the process
(often because they didn’t know it was important). Once you
figure out the step, reward people for following it going forward.
How to Calculate Returns From Lead-Getting Employees
Excluding the cost of running paid ads, the cost of advertising
(outreach, content, etc.) with employees is almost entirely based on
the amount of money you pay them to do it. We simplify this by
just comparing how much money we spend on payroll to how
much money the engaged leads they get bring in:
● Total Payroll / Total Engaged Leads = Cost per engaged lead.
○ Ex: $100,000 / 1000 leads = $100 per engaged lead
● If one out of ten of the engaged leads become customers then
our CAC is $1000
○ ($100 per engaged lead) x (10 engaged leads per
customer) = $1000 CAC
● If each customer has an LTGP of $4000 then you have an
LTGP : CAC of 4:1
○ ($4000 LTGP) / ($1000 CAC) = 4:1
For example: at the time of this writing, I get about 30,000
engaged leads per month at Acquistion.com. I run no paid ads, and
do no outreach. But the team responsible for creating the content
that generates that interest is about $100,000 per month. This
means, it costs me roughly $3.33 per engaged lead ($100,000 /
30,000 leads) in payroll to generate them. We make much more
than $3.33 per lead, so we’re profitable. You can apply the same
math to whatever advertising method you use.
How To Know Which Employees to Focus On To Maximize
Returns
Like we learned in Run Paid Ads Part II–if your cost to get a
customer is within 3x industry average then you’re doing good
enough. From there, you focus on bumping up your LTGP.
If your CAC is more than 3x industry average then you have a
sales problem or an advertising problem. We diagnose this with a
single question:
Do my engaged leads have the problem I solve and the money to
spend?
If no, then they’re not qualified–that’s an advertising problem.
If yes, then they’re qualified and:
They’re buying but you don’t have enough of them–
advertising problem.
They’re qualified but not buying–sales problem.
Don’t fire your sales guy if you’ve got advertising problems. And
equally, don’t fire your advertising employees if you’ve got a sales
problem. That little question can help you identify which
employees to focus on.
But fundamentally, you just need to figure out all your costs of
getting a customer put together. And as long as they’re at least onethird
of the profit you make over the lifetime, you’re in good
shape.
Conclusion
The goal of this chapter was to shift your perspective. It's your job
to advertise and sell the vision of your company. You advertise it
publicly and privately to employees and customers alike. That’s
the job. And once you get good at it, you become unstoppable.
I say this because I believe anyone can be taught to do "ground
level" jobs for any business– advertising or otherwise. So who you
pick is not as important as how you train the ones you do.
Like I've said throughout the book and will say again here–it
doesn't take a genius to advertise. I'd even say it hurts. We’ve got
plenty more iron-wills than brainiacs anyways. Remember, this
isn’t about brains, it's about guts. And although some people might
be born geniuses, nobody is born with an iron will (after all, we all
come out crybabies). All this to say having guts is a skill. And that
means anyone can have the guts if they learn how. So if you have
an iron-will, and as an entrepreneur you probably do, it won’t take
long for you to figure out that you got it from your life
experiences. You can pass those experiences on as lessons to
anyone who cares enough to listen. Then, they can stand on your
shoulders and have a better chance at succeeding in life.
And - you can’t really know anything anyway until you train them
well and give them a fighting chance to succeed out in the field.
Plus, for low level jobs, you'll never have a shortage of labor. Get
picky when you have to make massive investments in hyperspecific-
multiple-six-figure-C-suite employees. Aka - ‘fancy
employees.’
I find at this current stage, it's actually a better use of time, to hire
and train anyone willing. Then, when you find winners, and with
this method you will: treat them well, don’t burn them out, and
give them what they deserve.
In the land of overflowing leads, you’ll need allies. Employees are
among the most powerful of these allies. We talked about: how
they make you wealthy, how they work, how getting them works,
how to get them, how to get them getting you leads, how to keep
them getting you leads, and how to know you’re doing a good job.
And once you’ve built a system for getting people who get you
leads (doing the core four on your behalf), you just need to do
more.
The Next Lead Getter…
The next stop on our advertising journey leads us to agencies. Yes,
you can pay people to shortcut your path. I have paid zillions of
dollars to agencies and I believe I’ve finally *cracked* the code on
how to create a win for all parties. For us, so we’re not dependent
on them forever. For them, so they can make more profit and
provide more value to their customers. They’ve been key to many
breakthroughs I’ve had, so you won’t want to skip this next one…

#3 Agencies
“Everything is for sale”
Summer 2016.
I wasn’t a tech guy. I was a fitness guy who had learned a few
marketing and sales tricks building my gyms. But now I had five,
and was launching my sixth. It was time to level up. Facebook had
just released some new features: retargeting, interest groups,
pixels, etc. And I didn’t understand any of it. I bought a few
courses but ended up more confused than when I started.
I asked a few friends if they knew anyone who could help. I got
two referrals. Both were agencies. I was scared. I had never used
one before. I had only ever heard horror stories about advertising
agencies. Mostly that they cost a ton and never work. But then I
realized that even if they did work, I’d need them forever. They’d
have my business by the balls! It turns out my expectations weren’t
far off. They offered to run my ads alright, for an arm and a leg.
Money I couldn’t justify spending with my low margins. But, then
again, my advertising costs were killing me. And at this rate, in a
few months, I wouldn’t be able to keep my doors open. Stressful.
I refused the first agency because I couldn’t afford it at the time.
The second call started going the same way. I began to panic. How
am I gonna fix this? In what felt like a last ditch effort to stay in
business, I asked the second agency owner for what I really
wanted…
“Can you just show me in a few hours how you would run ads on
my account?”
“No.” He fired back. “My time’s not for sale.”
Worried but still hopeful…“What sort of arrangement could we
come to?”
He thought for a moment. Then his eyebrow shot up and a smirk
appeared. “Fine. $750 an hour.” Gulp. His intimidation tactic
worked. But at least I knew his time was for sale... so I wanted to
find out more.
“And for $750 per hour you will sit down with me and show me
how you would run my ads?”
“Yes.”
“And, I’d be the one doing everything? Like, you’ll walk me
through what to do and look over my shoulder as I do it, then
you’ll explain why you do it that way?”
“Yea”
“And you’re confident you can make my ads more profitable? …
and show me the more advanced stuff too, right?”
“Yea. I mean. If you wanna pay me $750 an hour, we can do
whatever you want. It’s your money” He said, half laughing. It
sounded more like It’s your funeral.
I paused. “Alright. I’ll do it. We’ll meet one hour a week. You give
me homework and I’ll study between calls. Fair enough?”
“Works for me. But you gotta pay for the first four hours up front”
So that’s what I did. I placed a three thousand dollar bet on this
guy’s word that he knew what he was doing. Yikes. But, every
week thereafter, I showed up. And like a good student, I came with
notes and questions ready. I also recorded and rewatched every call
because I didn’t want to miss anything.
The first two calls, he took the wheel and I watched. Calls three
and four, he put me in the driver’s seat. By calls five and six, it
clicked. I got how he made decisions and what data he tracked. At
seven and eight, I realized I didn’t need his help anymore. I had
learned how to run paid ads, at least on Facebook, like a pro. And,
if I had to make a guess, it was because I learned it…from a pro.
In this chapter, we explore a not-so-obvious-but-much-better-way
to use agencies to get more leads. Let’s get crankin’.
How Agencies Want You To Think They Work
Advertising agencies are lead-getting service businesses. You pay
them to run paid ads, do outreach, or package and distribute
content.
For example, let’s say you want to post free video content. But,
you know nothing about making video content or how to distribute
it. You’d need to learn how to pick video topics, record videos, edit
videos, make thumbnail images, and write headlines. Or, you’d
need to hire the people who do. Enter the agency. They say they’ve
hired and trained people to do that stuff already. So they promise
faster, better, and more cost-efficient results than you could get on
your own. And as soon as I had enough money, it felt compelling
enough.
After my first experience with an agency, that I mentioned earlier
and went quite well, I decided to use more. But my experience
with the next ten plus agencies was different because I used them
‘the right way.’ Each went something like this:
Step 1: They got me excited about all the new leads they would
bring.
Step 2: I’d go through an onboarding process that felt valuable
(and sometimes was).
Step 3: They assigned their “best” senior rep to my account.
Step 4: I saw some results.
Step 5: They moved my senior rep to the newest customer...
Step 6: A junior rep starts managing my account. My results
suffered.
Step 7: I complained.
Step 8: The senior rep would come back once in a while to make
me feel better.
Step 9: Results still suffered. And I’d eventually cancel.
Step 10: I’d search for another agency and repeat the cycle of
insanity.
Step 11: For the zillionth time–Start wondering why I wasn’t
getting results like the first time.
To be clear, like the introduction to this chapter shows, agencies
can play a valuable role in business growth. But not the way they
want you to. I don't want anyone else falling into the same trap. In
fact, I hope all the money I wasted goes towards paying down your
ignorance tax too. So keep reading.
It’s frankly ridiculous that it took me so many years to figure out
that I actually used an agency the right way…the first time! But
now, after playing their game so many times, I feel I cracked the
“how to use an agency” code. And it doesn’t come from playing
their game at all. It comes from playing a different one. And this
chapter breaks it all down in three steps:
1. Hiring an agency versus doing it yourself
2. How I use agencies now. And how you can, too.
3. How to pick the right agency
Hiring An Agency Versus Doing It Yourself
First, let’s get this out of the way. Good agencies cost money. So if
you have no money, then agencies are out of the question. You’ve
gotta learn through trial and error. And that’s no big deal. We all
start that way. But if you do have some money, I suggest using
agencies for two things: learning new methods and learning new
platforms.
If I want to learn new ways to do content, outreach, or paid ads,
then I hire agencies offering new ways to do them. They’ve
already made the big mistakes. So instead of wasting time figuring
it out myself, I skip straight to the ‘make money’ part. I like the
‘make money’ part.
I also use agencies when I want to start advertising on a platform I
don't understand. I make money faster because they do the early
setup and maintenance for me and because I get them to teach me
how to do it.
Hiring an agency is all about investing in important skills you can’t
really learn anywhere else. That is, unless you go through all the
trial and error to learn it yourself. And if you did, you lose the
time, and attention you could have used to learn the other
important stuff that scales your business. And scaling your
business is the whole point.
Action Step: As soon as you have enough money for a good
agency, start poking around. If you follow the rest of the steps in
this chapter, you’ll make it all back… and then some.
How I Use Agencies Now. And How You Can Too.
I’ve become a little more sophisticated than the story I told at the
beginning. Here’s how I use agencies now. Rather than believe the
lie that “I’ll never have to learn this stuff because they can do it,” I
start every agency relationship with a purpose and a deadline to
fulfill it. I open by saying:
“I want to do what you do in my business, but I don’t know how.
I’d like to work with you for 6 months so I can learn how you do it.
Plus, I’ll pay extra for you to break down why you make the
decisions you do and the steps you take to make them. Then, after I
get a good idea of how it all works, I’ll start training my team on
it. And once they can do it well enough, I’d like to change to a
lower cost consulting arrangement. This way, you can still help us
if we run into problems. Are you opposed to this?”
In my experience, most agencies are not opposed to this. And if it
doesn't work for them, that’s perfectly fine. Just move on to the
next agency. But, before you start kicking everyone to the curb, be
willing to negotiate. At some price, it’s worth it for both of you.
Viva capitalism!
This is how I use agencies now. Like when I wanted to learn
YouTube, I actually hired two agencies. The first, I hired to keep
me committed to making videos while they did some legwork on
the platform itself. The second I hired (at 4x the price) to really
teach us the in-depth ideas behind making the best content
possible. And once our videos beat their videos, we dropped down
to consulting only.
I’ve used this method again and again. I hire one “good enough”
agency to learn the ropes of a new platform. Then, I hire a more
elite agency to learn how to maximize it–and I cannot recommend
this strategy enough.
If you are upfront about your intentions and the agency agrees, you
get the best of both worlds. You get better short-term results
because they (probably) know more than you. And, you get better
long-term results because you learn how to do it yourself or your
team learns to do it for you. You also spend the maximum amount
of time with their best reps.
Remember, you only get a fraction of the agency’s attention, so
results get worse whenever they get new clients. Meanwhile, your
team gets better and better because they stay focused on you fulltime.
So compare your team’s results to the agency’s until you beat
them. Then, cancel the relationship and put the money into scaling
everything you just learned.
Action Step: When you find an agency to work with (next step)
set terms with them and deadlines for yourself. Use the template
above as your guide. And feel OK with negotiating a bit to make it
work.
How to Pick The Right Agency
After working with tons of bad agencies, and a handful of good
ones, I created a list of what all the good ones had in common.
Now it isn’t the last word on what makes a good agency, but it is
useful stuff that’s worked for me.
Here’s what I look for:
1) Somebody I know got good results working with them. If you
only know about an agency from their paid ads or cold
outreach… they probably aren’t as good as the ones who rely
solely on word of mouth (and the best ones do).
2) Prominent companies got good results working with them. I may
not know the companies personally, but if I recognize them, it’s
a good sign.
3) A waiting list. When demand for a service exceeds the supply,
they are probably pretty good.
4) A clear sales process that makes a point to set realistic
expectations. No funny business.
5) No short term hacks. They keep the talk on long term strategy.
They also give clear timelines for setup, scaling, and results.
6) They tell me exactly what they need from me, when they need it,
and how they use it.
7) They suggest a regular schedule of meetings and offer several
ways to update me on their progress.
8) They give updates in simple terms and have clear ways to track
so I know how costs compare with results.
9) They make a good offer:
a. Dream outcome: is what they promise what I want?
b. Perceived likelihood of achievement: how many other
people like me have they gotten there?
c. Time delay: how long will it take?
d. Effort and sacrifice: what do they require me to do when
working with them? What will I have to give up? Can I
stick with those for a long time?
10) They are expensive. All good agencies are expensive… but
not all expensive agencies are good. So talk with as many as it
takes. And use this list as a guide to find the good ones.
…if an agency checks those boxes, they’re worth considering.
Action step: Even if an agency agrees to your terms, talk with a
few more before you make a decision. Compare them using the
checklist above, and then pick the best one for you.
Conclusion
Even though this isn’t the “traditional” agency model, both
businesses benefit. They get a customer they otherwise wouldn't
have. And we get a money-making skill for life. In the story at the
beginning of the chapter - it cost me eight hours and $6000 to learn
a skill that’s made me millions. Does that seem worth it to you? It
better.
And to make this agency method work at scale, you have to count
on a good amount of time where you pay the agency and your team
to do the same stuff. You’ve gotta give yourself some breathing
room to get results from the agency, learn what they do, and train
your team on it... all at once. Yes, it costs a lot of money. And yes,
it’s totally worth it when you get it right.
And get it right you can. After agencies put a low level employee
on my account for the millionth time, it finally clicked. This can’t
be that hard. At first, it took about a year to get my team better
than an agency. As I got better, it went down to ten months, then
eight. And now, I’ve got it down. I can get my team as good or
better than the agency in less than six months or less. And every
time I want to learn a new method or platform, I repeat the process.
The better you get, the cheaper it becomes, and the more money
you make. Funny, that sounds a lot like advertising.
Next Steps:
1) Decide if using an agency makes sense for you right now.
2) Talk to a lot of agencies to get a feel for the market. Don’t be
cheap.
3) Use the agreement framework I outlined.
4) Set a clear deadline to force you (and your team) to learn the
skills.
5) Use both teams until yours beats theirs regularly.
6) Switch to discounted consulting until you feel like you’re
teaching them instead of them teaching you…then cut ‘em
loose.
Now that we know how to profit from the high risk world of
agencies, we explore the lead-getter that’s made me the most
money. We recruit an army of businesses who can get us even
more leads - affiliates.

#4 Affiliates and Partners
“Nothing makes friends like money”
December 1st, 2018
I had no idea how the Prestige Labs launch would go. I had no idea
if our clients would like it. I had no idea if the technology we built
would work. I had no idea if payouts would happen on time. I had
no idea if our warehouse would mess up orders.
But I did know over a year of preparation went into this launch.
We put everything we had into creating a top-tier product. We
spent over $1,000,000 custom-building affiliate software and
training. And - we bought $3,000,000 in inventory for sales that
may never happen. It took every business skill I had to make
Prestige Labs real. And, in just a few hours, we would roll it out to
our gym owner affiliates. I felt like a kid on Christmas Eve. And if
it didn’t work, it wouldn’t be for lack of effort.
Launch day…
I finished the two-hour presentation soaked in sweat. It’s done.
I ‘sold’ the opportunity to sell my supplement line at their gyms. I
would train the new affiliates to promote Prestige Labs at their
gyms. So, for this to work, they would have to go through the
training and use it. But, if they did, everyone would profit. I had no
idea if it would work.
Three weeks later…
We made $150,000 in total sales. Meanwhile, $3,000,000 worth of
product sat in an air-conditioned warehouse… It didn’t work.
At this rate, including operating costs and affiliate payouts, it
would take five years to break even. Even if we could stick it out,
our premium product would expire well before then. We were all
but screwed. I felt miserable. It was terrible. Who am I to think we
would sell all that stuff? I just wasted MILLIONS. How could I be
so stupid?
But…on the fourth week…something wild happened…
BOOM! $100,000 on Monday.
BOOM! $110,000 on Tuesday
BOOM! $92,000 on Wednesday.
We did over $450,000 in sales the fourth week alone. The trend
continued. $429,000…$383,000…$411,000…$452,000. We
averaged more than 300 orders per day across 400+ active
affiliates. Orders just kept coming in. Check out the snapshot of
our internal report below. It shows, from left to right, revenue by
week. I couldn’t believe the results. Sometimes, I still can’t.
The best part is, I didn’t advertise or sell any of the products at all.
No paid ads. No sales team. Nothing. The affiliates did everything–
and the affiliate machine I built still prints money to this day. So if
that sounds like something you’re interested in, hang tight, because
I’m gonna show you exactly how I built it.
How Affiliates Work
An affiliate is a lead-getter. They are an independent business that
tells their audience to buy your stuff. Affiliates seem like referrals
on the outside, but are much different under the hood. First, they
have their own businesses and do their own advertising. Second,
they agree to offer your stuff to their engaged leads in exchange
for money, free stuff, or both.
Now, you get affiliates by advertising and then making them offers
just like you would customers. But, affiliates demand a unique type
of offer. Instead of offering your product, you offer a fast, simple,
and easy way to make commissions promoting it. And that can
mean literally millions of engaged leads to your business. So this
makes affiliates one of the highest-leverage lead-getters out there.
Why You Want An Affiliate Army
Each affiliate you get adds another stream of leads and customers.
So recruiting, activating, then integrating with an army of affiliates
causes crazy scaling, fast. That's good. We want that.
Compare these two scenarios:
Scenario #1: You sell ten customers per month worth $10,000
each. Your business caps at $100,000 per month. In twelve months
you’ve made 1.2 million. Assuming no other advertising, your
business plateaus. Low-Leverage.
Scenario #2: For the same effort, you sell ten affiliates per month.
Each month, those affiliates bring you one of those $10,000
customers. Now, every single month you add an extra $100,000 in
revenue. In twelve months you’ve made 7.8 million. And it grows
every month thereafter. Same work, more money. High-Leverage.
Let’s use ALAN, my software company I grew with affiliates, to
show how this works in the real world:
ALAN grew with three levels of affiliates:
1) Agency super-affiliates who brought agency leads
2) Agencies who brought local business leads
3) Local businesses who brought end consumer leads
One super-affiliate added ten agencies per month. The ten agencies
brought in a combined fifty or so local businesses per month.
Those local businesses brought in a combined 2500 leads per
month. ALAN worked those leads for about $5 a pop. A cool
$12,500 per month.
But it didn’t stop there. Each super-affiliate brought in more
agencies who brought in more local businesses who brought more
leads every month after that. So every super-affiliate we signed on
brought in $12,500 the first month, $25,000 the second, $37,500
the third, and so on. With only a few agency super-affiliates, we
scaled to $1,700,000 per month within six months of launching.
That’s why you want an affiliate army. So let’s build one.
How To Build An Affiliate Army in Six Steps
Affiliates are among the most advanced ways to get engaged leads.
First, you have to convince them to advertise someone else's stuff.
Second, you have to convince them to advertise your stuff. Third,
you have to keep them advertising to make them a long-term lead
source. It seems like a lot. And it is. But, I have good news…
I’ve built two companies with affiliates: ALAN and Prestige Labs.
Together, they have done more than $75,000,000 in revenue from
over 5000+ affiliates. And the affiliate strategies I share worked for
me. So they can work for you. I’ll break down each step.
Step 1: Find Your Ideal Affiliates
Step 2: Make Them an Offer
Step 3: Qualify Them
Step 4: Figure Out What To Pay Them
Step 5: Get Them Advertising
Step 6: Keep Them Advertising
That’s it. Let’s dive in.
Step 1: Find Your Ideal Affiliate
The ideal affiliate has a business with a warm audience full of
people like your customers. Start making a list of those businesses.
If none come to mind, answer these questions about your best
customers:
What do they buy? → Who provides that stuff?
Where do they go? → What businesses are in those surrounding
areas?
What do they like to do? → Who provides those services?
If direct to consumer–the employers of your consumers could
make great affiliates:
What types of businesses do they work for? What kinds of jobs do
they have?
In a nutshell… Who’s got my leads!?
For example, when I started ALAN, agency owners were my ideal
affiliate. So I made a list of 200 products and services for agencies
and the businesses that delivered them. After a little bit of work I
realized they fit pretty neatly into categories: softwares, products,
equipment, services, groups they belong to, and events they
attended. Every time I create a new affiliate “hit list” I start with
these categories. Note: If you find a business that falls into
multiple categories, there’s a high chance they’ve got lots of good
leads for you and that they’d make a great affiliate.
Now that I knew the businesses that had my leads I knew exactly
where to put my advertising efforts. It wasn’t fancy, so don’t
overthink it.
Action Step: Make a sheet with each of these questions and
categories. Search online to fill it in. If you struggle, call up your
customers and ask them! End result: Create a lead list of your
highest potential affiliates.
Step 2: Make Them An Offer
We make the affiliate-offer and advertise it the same way we
would any other offer. We call out our audience, show our value
elements, and then call them to action. But affiliates will only sign
up with us if we give them a strong reason. Thankfully, it’s pretty
simple. Since affiliates are businesses, or start a business by
signing up, you offer them a new way to make money. We’ll start
with the callout.
Call out:
Call outs for potential affiliates often include:
The affiliate business owners themselves - ATTENTION SPA
OWNERS
The affiliate’s customers - Do you work with busy professionals
who spend all day in meetings?
Results the affiliate businesses promise - To the heroes who heal
the stress of others…
Products and services the affiliates deliver - If you sell lotions or
scented oils this is for you…
To our own customers - Do you know anyone who owns a spa?
Now that we can grab a potential affiliate’s attention - let’s make it
worth their while…
Elements Of Value
There’s an unlimited number of ways to show value, but all money
making offers follow a similar structure. That’s good news, we
don't need to reinvent the wheel. Most affiliate money making
offers show value like this:
Make more money from your current customers and get more leads
than your current offer (dream outcome)…with a high chance of
working since your customers already want the product (perceived
likelihood of achievement)...without needing to build, deliver, or
provide customer support for the product yourself (effort and
sacrifice)...so you can start selling it tomorrow (time delay).
Action Step: Explore the different value elements and fill in the
blanks. I won't go deeper on this since we’ve covered it already.
You simply need to make affiliates the customer you’re advertising
to.
Now that we’ve got the potential affiliate interested in our offer,
let’s qualify them.
Step 3: Qualify Them
Potential affiliates become actual affiliates when they understand
and agree to your terms. And - just like customers - we want to get
them their first win as fast as possible. So we setup our terms to
force them to win as fast as possible.
I do that by getting them to invest. I prefer they invest their time,
their money, and in the product itself. Any can work. But, nine
times out of ten, if they pay, they’ll pay attention. Here are the two
ways I get my affiliates invested and winning: make them a
customer, and make them an expert. Let’s dive into each.
Way #1: Make Them A Customer: Make them buy and
preferably use the product to keep affiliate status. This is the
lowest barrier investment that’s worked for me. I’ve found the
more money an affiliate invests in your product, the more money
they make. This should make sense. If they don’t believe in your
stuff enough to buy it, they probably shouldn’t sell it. You can tell
them I said so.
Way #2: Make Them An Expert: I make them pay for the
onboarding and training that certifies them as a product expert. If
you have them buy a product to become an affiliate, you can have
them use that as credit towards a certification. As in, the
certification comes with the products they bought. Now, aside from
actually making the affiliate useful, certifying them does two
things. First, it covers some of the costs of advertising. Second, it
means I can afford proper onboarding and training of every. single.
affiliate.
How much do I charge? I recommend 10-20% of what the
average active affiliate makes in the first twelve months. So if your
average affiliate makes $40,000 per year selling your stuff, then
charge $4000-$8000 to onboard and train them. Too low, and you
won’t get them invested. Too high and you won’t get enough
affiliates. I found 10-20% maximizes the number of people who
become active affiliates. If you’re just getting started and have
physical products then use the bulk purchasing strategy from the
pro tip. Otherwise, you can use the strategy from the warm
reachout chapter and raise the minimum investment every 5 sign
ups until you hit the sweet spot.
Action Step: Make your affiliates customers, experts, or both (my
favorite way). If you don't get enough people to start, lower the
commitment. If you don't get enough people to follow through,
raise it.
Step 4: Figure Out What To Pay Them
The first biggest problem to solve with affiliates is getting them
bought in. But the second biggest problem is how to keep them
bought in. And no matter how you slice it, keeping your affiliates
bought in depends on how you reward them for advertising your
stuff. I prefer to reward people that do things I like with money and
free stuff, especially if they make me money first. So let’s talk
about that.
When I figure out ways to pay affiliates I look at two basic things:
1. What they get paid for
2. How much they get paid
1. What They Get Paid For
Before I do any affiliate payout money math I ask myself a simple
question. What exactly do I want the affiliate to do? Once I figure
that out, that is what I pay them for. Then, more often than not,
how much they get paid and how often they get paid nearly solve
themselves. I pay affiliates for two basic things: new customers,
and repeat customers. Over time, if you track your metrics better,
you can pay them for steps before someone becomes a customer.
Like for the lead magnets downloaded, appointments set, or
anything else you know reliably turns into sales for you.
2. How Much They Get Paid
I suggest paying affiliates based on your maximum allowable cost
to acquire a customer (CAC).
Example: choosing your maximum allowable CAC. Let’s say we
sell a single-use product for $200 and it costs $40 to fulfill. This
gives us $160 to pay the affiliate and run the business. If we want
an LTGP:CAC ratio of 3:1 then three parts goes to the business–
$120. And one part, $40, goes to the affiliate. This means we will
pay up to $40 for an affiliate to get a new customer.
But here’s where things get interesting. I used to give away the
farm (the whole CAC). I suppose I still do, but I’ve gotten pickier
about who I give it to. Not all affiliates are created equal. So, I
suggest having a three-tier payout structure. Using the example
above, with a $40 maximum allowable CAC, a three-tier payout
structure might look something like this:
● Tier 1: 25% CAC = $10 Payout - Anyone who agrees to my initial
terms qualifies.
○ Example: They sign up and buy products or a certification.
● Tier 2: 50% CAC = $20 Payout - Once they activate.
○ Example: actually finishing the certification they bought,
doing a specific number of posts and outreach, doing a
launch, etc.
○ This gives them a nice reward (twice the pay) for activating.
● Tier 3: 100% CAC = $40 Payout - Once they sustain a level of
performance.
○ Example: They maintain five customers per month on
subscription.
This tiered method also has a hidden and very profitable side
effect. The average payout is much less than your maximum
allowable CAC. This means if we leave the maximum payouts for
top affiliates, then we get to keep the “leftover” profit. We can use
the leftover money to run huge contests, advertise to get more
affiliates, incentivize rising stars, etc. Or, I suppose, we can just
plain pocket it.
For example, if 20% of sales come from tier 1, 20% from tier 2,
and 60% from tier 3, your blended payout is $30 instead of your
maximum allowable CAC of $40. This means your LTGP : CAC
ratio just improved from 3:1 to 4:1. And often, cutting marketing
costs by 33% can translate into 10% to 20% more net profit at the
end of the year. A massive jump.
Action step: Figure out what you want to pay your affiliates for so
that you can plan out how much to pay them, with what, and how
often.
Step 5: Get Them Advertising – Launch
Like referrers, how much value affiliates get from you determines
how much they advertise your stuff. So, treat them like customers.
Give them something good, fast. And nothing does that for
affiliates like big launches and lots of cash.
Here’s how launches work:
Affiliates advertise your lead magnet or core offer to their audience
before they can buy it. They post. They do warm outreach. They
run paid ads. They may even do cold outreach. They do as much
advertising as they can until the day of launch. When the product is
available, they sell it to all the engaged leads they assembled.
Some sell one-on-one, some pitch to the whole group. And others
simply make the product available.
So if you’re gonna do launches to activate your affiliates, which
you should, you may as well do them right. I use the whispertease-
shout method. I can’t remember where I first heard this, but
the name stuck. Let’s launch.
Before we get launching, remember: good launches have the work
done ahead of time. So do all the work for them. Then, they can
plug and play. Let’s break down each launch phase. And, I’ll give
an example of my book launch to drive each point home. Note: this
is how you launch anything, not just affiliates. I put it in the
affiliates section because I haven’t found a better way to activate
affiliates than launches.
Whisper: Think “Call Outs.” Like an ad, the key to the whisper
phase is curiosity. Keep the product itself mysterious and hint at
how big of a deal it is. Keep whispers short. And bonus points if
you show behind the scenes of making your product.
If you have something in the works, you can start the whisper
phase a few years out. The further out you start whispering, the
bigger deal it becomes to your audience. We start this early
because, the longer something appears to take, the more an
audience will value it. For example, all other things being equal, an
audience will value a product that took ten years to make more
than one that took ten days. So - show your work.
Remember: curiosity comes from wanting to know what happens
next. So embed questions about the product in their minds. We
need to tell them about something they want to know more about,
then say…not yet.
For example during the whisper phase of my book launch: I posted
content, reached out to friends, emailed my list, and told potential
affiliates about major updates to the book. I showed what draft I
was on. I took pictures behind the scenes of me printing out drafts.
I showed the many versions of the frameworks I drew. I shared
videos of myself editing the book early in the morning and late at
night, etc…all of it made people who want leads get curious and
pay attention.
Action Step: Start whispering every four to six weeks until you get
sixty days out. Then whisper every two to three weeks until you
get thirty days out. Then, start teasing…
Tease: Think “Elements Of Value.” It’s time to start satisfying all
the curiosity you created during the whisper phase. Reveal your
product, make the date of the launch public, and start showing the
elements of value. Use the What-Who-When Framework from the
paid ads chapter.
For example during my book launch, the tease phase: I was more
specific and revealed more “hard” information about the book. I
started advertising how the book satisfied the dream outcome of
limitless leads. Of doing less work, and getting it done faster than
they could imagine. I also showed dozens of examples using the
book to its potential.
Action Step: Start teasing once per week until fourteen days out.
Then tease twice per week until three days out. Three days out, it’s
time to shout from the rooftops.
Shout: Think “Call to Action.” Give specific actions for the
audience to take when the product launches. Now you start
pounding the audience with bonuses, scarcity, urgency, and
guarantees around being “the first ones.” You shout to get as many
people exposed to your offer as you can.
For example during my book launch, the shout phase: I gave
specific calls to action. Short, sweet, clear reminders to register for
the book launch. I reminded everyone of the exclusive bonuses
only for people who bought during the launch.
Action Step: Shout at least twice a day starting three days out. On
the day of, start shouting every few hours until two hours out. Then
shout every thirty minutes until you launch the product.
Action Step: Get your affiliates to launch. Set them up with
everything they need to do the whisper-tease-shout right. They do
the advertising. You get the engaged leads. Everyone gets paid.
Step 6: Keep Them Advertising
The strategy we use to start them advertising differs from the one
we use to keep them advertising. In an ideal world, you sell an
affiliate once and they send engaged leads for life. Integration gets
us there.
I’ve got three ways you can integrate your product into their offer.
I order these from easiest to hardest. First, you can get them to give
away your lead magnet with every purchase of their stuff. Second,
you can get them to sell your lead magnet separately to their
audience. Third, you can get them to directly sell your core offer.
They give away your lead magnet for free, which makes their core
offer more valuable for no extra cost. Then, you upsell your core
offer and every offer thereafter.
1) Affiliates Give Your Lead Magnet Away When Somebody
Buys Their Stuff. The idea here is for your lead magnet to make
the affiliate’s offer more valuable. This allows them to charge more
for it and get more leads than they could without it. Remember, the
best lead magnets give away a free trial or sample of your thing,
reveal a problem, or offer a single step of a multi-step solution.
Here are examples of each:
Samples And Trials: Say I sell massages and recruit the personal
training studio next door as an affiliate. Now, everyone who buys
personal training from them gets a free massage from me. The
personal training studio now has a stronger offer they can charge
more for and we get more massage leads. Everybody wins.
Reveal a Problem: Instead of giving a free massage, we offer a free
or discounted posture assessment with every training package they
sell. Assessments and discounts add less value to the affiliate’s
offer, but some people will still do it. And to be clear, after
assessing the customer, you make them an offer to solve the
problems you revealed.
One Step In A Multi-Step Process: Say you have a three-part
treatment plan. Massage, stretching, and adjustments. People
getting enough value from one step will fear missing out on the
rest of the steps. So the more they think the other steps will help
solve their larger problem, the more likely they are to buy them.
Your affiliate would give away step one of your multi-step process
for free. You’d upsell the leads from there.
What I did. We’d get gym affiliates to give away a free nutrition
consult to every new member. Then, we’d upsell our products at
the consult. They can market that they have nutrition consults
included to get more leads and they could charge more for the
added value. And we get the opportunity to sell those leads.
Everybody wins.
They sell their core offer. Then, they upsell your lead magnet.
Then, you upsell your core offer and every offer thereafter.
2) Affiliates Sell Your Lead Magnet. Basically, the affiliate can
sell anything of yours that turns their customers into your
customers. It could be a book, an event, a service, software, a
sample product, etc. Also, giving affiliates all the cash from selling
a lead magnet you fulfill becomes all profit and no work for them–
an attractive proposition for any business. Your money comes by
selling your main thing for more than it cost you to deliver your
lead magnet. And if you do it this way, you don't need to split any
money with them on your core offer. Another win-win.
Example: They sell each of those things we gave away for free in
the step above. They sell your massage at a discounted price. They
sell your assessment (which you could do 1-1 or in a group format
like a workshop). They sell part one of your multi-step solution.
What I did. The gyms would sell a nutrition consult with us and
keep the money. They’d maybe charge $99 or $199 to sell an hour
of our time. If we were clever, we’d let them keep all the money. If
we do, they’ll send us even more leads. Then, we’d upsell our
products during the consult.
…then you split the money. Either you split the upfront cash, all
cash for a certain period of time, or all cash forever. I prefer to pay
forever so my affiliates stay motivated to keep my customers
forever. And, I never cap payouts.
3) Affiliates Sell Your Core Offer. An affiliate sells your core
offer directly to their customers and adds another source of income
without extra work. For some affiliates, this is their entire source of
income! Many companies offer this structure as either a new
business opportunity or a bolt-on to the affiliate’s existing
business. Either way, anything you sell, they can sell. When you do
it this way, the affiliate will get a higher percentage of your
lifetime gross profit - but - you won’t have to do anything but
deliver.
Example: They sell your entire massage package. They sell your
entire program or services. They bundle their services with your
paid services and charge an even higher price.
What I did. We taught gyms to hold nutrition consultations with
white labeled products. Then we taught them to upsell our
supplements right to their members and we split the money.
All three strategies work. They’re just different. After testing, we
continue to do Strategy 1 (twice per year as a big event) and
Strategy 3 on an ongoing basis. That being said, many similar
businesses in our portfolio use Strategy 2. I'm just sharing what
worked for us.
Bottom Line: Integration is the long term strategy for using
affiliates to get enduring lead flow. Treat affiliates like customers.
Make your offer make sense for their business. Make it so good
they’d feel stupid saying no.
Action Step: Integrate with your affiliates by choosing whether
you want them to give your lead magnet away, to sell your lead
magnet, or to sell your core offer directly.
Those are the six steps to recruiting an affiliate army. Now that we
covered that, let me give you three real-life case studies to drive
this home.
Three Case Studies You Can Model
Service Business Case Study #1: National Tax Preparation
Services
My friend's $50M business prepares LLCs, bank accounts, and
articles of incorporation. He focuses on people starting businesses
for the first time. But, he doesn't try to compete with Legalzoom.
Instead, he built it partnering with people who train new
entrepreneurs. His strategy is simple: help those people sell more
of their stuff by also selling his stuff. So, he offers every affiliate’s
customer a free LLC setup. Remember learning about the “high
cost lead magnet” from Section II? This is one of those.
Launch: He does a big blast off seminar to his affiliates’ audiences
to kick things off. People happily take him up on his free LLC
offer. That's his lead magnet.
Integrate: Once affiliates see the success of the launch, they
integrate his lead magnet into their core offer. Then, my friend’s
team gets on the phone with the customers his affiliates bring him
for free. Here's how he makes his money. He sells them what
they'll need next. The services they'll need to start their business:
bookkeeping, tax preparation, etc.
He hasn’t spent a dollar on paid ads. His true advertising costs are
two things. One, delivering his free lead magnet (the LLC setup).
And two, paying a percentage of every first sale to the affiliates
that sent them. That's it. And everybody wins.
Physical Products Case Study #2: Prestige Labs, my supplement
company
We sell gym owners at Gym Launch and train them how to
advertise and sell their gym memberships. Prestige Labs has a line
of supplements for active adults. This makes Gym Launch a
perfect affiliate for Prestige Labs. It has a community of gym
owners that also have active adult customers. So when Gym
Launch sells a new gym owner, they introduce the new gym
owners to Prestige Labs. Then the Prestige Labs team follows the
“launch then integrate” strategy above. (We really do this).
Launch: We give the gym owners advertising materials so they
can re-engage their current and former customers. We focus on
warm outreach and posting free content for a free 28 day
challenge. When they come in for the free challenge, gym owners
sell them supplements to use with the program. The gym owner
gets more customers. They make money. We make money.
Everyone wins.
Integrate: After the launch, we teach them to sell supplements to
every new gym member. So when new clients buy a membership
package, the gym owner sets up a nutrition orientation. At the
nutrition orientation, the gym owner sells them $50-$1000 of
supplements. So if a gym signs up twenty clients per month, and
gets seventy percent of them to buy supplements, we get fourteen
new customers per month per gym. It doesn’t sound like much, but
when you multiply 4000 gyms x 14 new sales per month x $200
average order = a lot of money every month.
Local Business Case Study #3: Chiropractors
Chiropractors want new patients. And a portfolio company of ours
teaches them to use an affiliate strategy to get them. Their model is
simple: go to high volume businesses that have people that are in
need of adjustments. A gym fits the bill nicely. Here’s what they
do.
Launch: They get the gym owner to promote a three hour
workshop where they show correct exercises and posture to get
more from their workouts. The gym owner promotes the workshop
for free or sells the workshop for $29-$99 per person. The
chiropractor splits the money with the gym owner. Hint: if you
give the affiliate (gym owner in this case) 100% of the money,
they’ll want to do it more. So if a gym gets thirty people to show
up for $99, they make $2970 profit for zero work besides a few
emails and posts. At the workshop the chiropractor soft pitches
their services and gets a bucket of new patients. Easy peasy lemon
squeezy.
Integrate: Long term, the chiropractor convinces the gym owner
to include one to two adjustments with every new membership the
gym signs up. This increases the value of the gym membership
compared to the guy down the street. And, it shows the gym
prioritizes its members health and safety (a big concern for
beginners). Win win. Now, every new gym member becomes a
lead for the chiropractor to follow up with. They repeat this
process with thirty gyms, and get more patients than they can
handle.
Costs and Returns
“Affiliates can’t work for my business” the loser said.
“I have to make affiliates work for my business” the winner said.
Be a winner.
When calculating returns with other methods, we compared
lifetime gross profit (LTGP) with cost to acquire a customer
(CAC). So we spend money to get customers and the customers, in
a profitable business, give us more money back. Affiliates work
differently. We spend money to get affiliates, sure. But we don’t
really make much back from affiliates themselves. Instead, the
money we spend to get an affiliate comes back from the customers
they bring us. So to calculate returns, we compare how much it
costs us to get an affiliate with the gross profit of all the customers
they send to our business.
Example:
Let’s say we own a widget company that grows with affiliates.
● It costs us $4000 in advertising to get an affiliate. CAC = $4000
● Our average affiliate sells $10,000 in widgets per month and stays
for 12 months.
○ ($10,000 per month ) x (12 months) = $120,000 total sales
● The widgets have 75% gross margins. In other words, they cost
25% of retail price to make.
○ ($120,000 total sales) x (25% cost of goods) = $30,000 total
cost of goods
○ ($120,000 total sales ) - ($30,000 total cost of goods) =
$90,000 in gross profit from all the customers the affiliate
brings
● We pay affiliates 40% of the gross profit:
○ ($90,000 gross profit) x (40% payout) = $36,000 to the
affiliate as payment.
● Here’s the gross profit we have left after cost of goods and payouts:
○ ($120,000 total) - ($30,000 costs) - ($36,000 payouts) =
$54,000 leftover
● Let’s find our affiliate LTGP to CAC ratio:
○ ($54,000 gross profit left) / ($4000 to get an affiliate) = 12.5 :
1
…Not too shabby.
If you recall from earlier, we need to be at least at 3:1 to have a
decent business. Like the example, we want the ratio even higher
than that (5:1, 10:1+). Now, if we had these numbers, we’d just do
more. But, if your actual LTGP : CAC is less than 3, here are the
three ways to improve it:
1)Lower CAC: We get affiliates for less (by improving our ads, offer,
and sales process).
2)Increase LTGP & Decrease CAC: Get more to activate (by creating
a launch process).
3)Increase LTGP: We make them worth more (by improving our
integration process).
With affiliates, you now have at least two layers of customers.
Your customers, and the people who get you customers. And if
you’ve got super-affiliates you add a third, the people who get you
the people who get you customers! This adds complexity, but if
you can manage it, it’s worth it.
Now that you understand how to use affiliates to advertise, and
how to make them more profitable– let’s bring it all home.
Conclusion
Like referrals, affiliates aren’t an advertising method you can ‘do.’
They’re people who advertise your stuff to benefit you both. You
do the core four to get them, and if you want them to love you,
then you treat them like customers. Because in a lot of ways, they
are. And if you deliver more value to them than it costs them to get
it (especially hidden costs), they’ll get you more leads than you can
handle.
And like we learned earlier, there are two ways to create a
compounding business. You can find more people that never stop
buying your stuff or you can find more people who never stop
selling it for you. Referrals are the former. Affiliates are the ladder.
In theory, once you build an affiliate army, you never need to
advertise again. They keep getting you leads month after month.
The main reason - it makes sense for them. The way you do
business, your leadership, and the value of your product all come
into play. You are only as good as the goodwill you have with your
affiliate partners. Arrange it right and you should both be better off
from the relationship. They should be able to spend more to
acquire customers through a more compelling offer, higher profits,
or both. And, in return, you get more engaged leads. So why
doesn’t everyone do this? They don’t know it’s possible. They
don’t know how. Or, they don’t want to. Simple as that. Hopefully
we solved all three of those issues at once.
Remember, advertising always works, it’s only a matter of
efficiency. So once you start, keep going until it works.
Action Steps
Advertise your affiliate offer until you get ten to twenty affiliates.
Get results with those affiliates and use their feedback to work the
kinks out of your offer, terms, launches, and integration strategy.
Then, scale like crazy by turning their results into your first batch
of affiliate lead magnets.
Section IV Conclusion: Get Lead Getters
“The last skill you ever need to learn is how to get other people to
do everything you need for you.”
We do the core four to get engaged leads: warm outreach, post
content, cold outreach, and paid ads. And we use them to get two
types of engaged leads: the ones that become customers, or the
ones we turn into lead getters. Lead getters come in four flavors:
Referrers, Employees, Agencies, and Affiliates. Each have key
strengths:
Customer referrals have the biggest potential for low-cost
exponential growth.
Employees have your direct influence and run your business on
your behalf.
Agencies teach skills you keep forever and can transfer to your
team.
Affiliates, once you get them going, can operate entirely on their
own.
You can either do the advertising or other people can. And there
are more “other people” than there are of you. You get more leads
for the work you do when you have help. So if you want to get a
ton of leads, this is the way.
Maybe your head is officially spinning. Now that you understand
these advertising methods, you see leads everywhere you look. We
have so many ways to grow! And you’d be right. But...you don't
know which one to focus on.
Any or all of these lead methods can underpin a successful leadgetting
strategy, and I put them in the order of what happens
naturally. If you start on your own, you tend to get your first
referrals before you start building a big team. And when you start
building a big team (employees) you’ll probably start looking for
professional help (agencies). And only when a business owner has
a handle on managing people inside of their business do they tend
to get the guts to try and manage people outside their business
(affiliates). In any case, you have to forget the idea that everything
is going to work out the first time.
If you think you’re going to become a millionaire the first year you
go out on your own, you’re probably wrong. It’s very unlikely.
And an obsession with “getting rich quick” will likely ensure it
never happens. People try shortcuts for a decade until they realize
they should have picked a strategy and stuck with it for a decade. If
you do that, success is inevitable. Once you find something that
works for you–stick to what you pick. Those are the best words of
encouragement I can offer. The longer you play the game, the
better you will get, and the more success you will have. Just don't
quit or switch methods after seeing a few losses. It’s normal to lose
in the beginning. In fact, I expect to crack a new lead source in
three to six months (and this isn’t my first rodeo). So if your
expectations are faster than that, do you think your expectations
are reasonable?
We covered a lot here. This section was how you scale: you get
other people to help you. They are the missing link. Each has their
own strategy and best practices. Use what applies to you now.
This leads us to Section V: Get Started. I want to put everything
together for you in a nice bow so you know exactly what to do
next. Together, we’ll eliminate leads as the bottleneck in your
business forever. Onwards!
