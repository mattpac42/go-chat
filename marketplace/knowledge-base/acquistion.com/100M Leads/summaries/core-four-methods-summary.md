# $100M Leads: The Core Four Methods Summary

**Source**: Section III - Get Leads

## The Fundamental Framework

There are only **four ways** to let anyone know about anything you sell. These methods emerge from two simple distinctions:

**Two Types of Audiences**:
1. **Warm**: People who gave permission to contact them (friends, family, followers, customers, contacts)
2. **Cold**: People who have not given permission (strangers, other people's audiences, purchased lists)

**Two Ways to Communicate**:
1. **One-to-One** (Private): Phone calls, emails, DMs—only one person receives message at a time
2. **One-to-Many** (Public): Social media, billboards, podcasts—many people receive message simultaneously

**The Core Four Matrix**:
- **Warm + One-to-One = Warm Outreach**
- **Warm + One-to-Many = Posting Content**
- **Cold + One-to-One = Cold Outreach**
- **Cold + One-to-Many = Paid Ads**

**Critical Insight**: If you're not getting enough leads, you're either not doing the Core Four with enough skill or enough volume.

## Method #1: Warm Outreach

### How It Works

One-to-one contact with people who know you. The cheapest, easiest, and most reliable way to get early customers. It always works—as certain as the sunrise.

### The 10-Step Process

**Step 1: Get Your List**
- Phone contacts (have subscribed to communication from you)
- Email accounts (contacts from all emails you've ever used)
- Social media (followers, friends, connections across all platforms)
- Most people have 1,000+ leads between all platforms without realizing it

**Step 2: Pick a Platform**
- Start with platform with most contacts
- Phone, email, social media, mail, etc.
- You'll eventually hit all platforms

**Step 3: Personalize Your Greeting**
- Use something you know about the contact as your reason to reach out
- Check social media if you don't have personal info
- Example: "Saw you just had a baby! Congrats! How is the baby doing?"

**Step 4: Reach Out**
- **100 people per day** (Rule of 100)
- Up to 3 times (once per day for 3 days or until they respond)
- Physical mail: once per week

**Step 5: Use A-C-A Framework When They Respond**

**A**cknowledge: Restate what they said in your own words (shows active listening)
- Example: "Two kids and you're an accountant..."

**C**ompliment: Tie to positive character trait if possible
- Example: "Wow! Supermom! So hardworking managing full-time career and two kids..."

**A**sk: Lead conversation toward your offer
- Therapy example: "Do you get time for yourself?"
- Fitness example: "Do you have time to get workouts in?"
- Cleaning example: "Do you have anyone helping keep the house tidy?"

**Step 6: Make Them an Offer**

After 3-4 exchanges (messaging) or 3-4 minutes (in person), use the Value Equation:

**Four Elements of Value**:
1. **Dream Outcome**: Best possible results your product gets
2. **Perceived Likelihood**: Results, reviews, guarantees, endorsements
3. **Time Delay**: How fast people get results
4. **Effort & Sacrifice**: Good stuff they keep/get, bad stuff they avoid

**The Script**:
"By the way, do you know anybody who is [describe struggles] looking to [dream outcome] in [time delay]? I'm taking on five case studies for free, because that's all I can handle. I just want testimonials. I help them [dream outcome] without [effort/sacrifice]. It works. I guarantee people get [outcome] or I work with them until they do. I had [similar person] work with me and [achieved outcome] even though they [same struggle]. I'd just like more testimonials. Does anyone you like come to mind? ...And if they say no... Haha, well does anyone you hate come to mind?"

**Shorter Version**: "I help [ideal customer] get [dream outcome] in [time period] without [effort/sacrifice] and [increase perceived likelihood]."

**Step 7: Make It Easy to Say Yes—Make It Free**

"Since I'm only taking five people, I can give you all the attention to get brag-worthy results. I'll give it all free so long as you: 1) Use it 2) Give feedback 3) Leave killer review if it deserves one. Fair?"

**Why First Five Free Works**:
1. You get comfortable making offers
2. You probably suck initially—people forgive free
3. You learn how to suck less through reps
4. People provide feedback, reviews, and referrals
5. Free customers make money three ways: convert to paid, send paying referrals, testimonials bring customers

**Step 8: Start Back at the Top**
- After all leads on one platform, move to platform with second-most leads
- Cycle through all platforms

**Step 9: Start Charging**
- When people start referring, start charging
- "80% off for next five" → "60% off for next five" → "40% off" → eventually full price
- Add urgency: "I increase my prices every five"
- Keep raising 20% every five until you find sweet spot

**Step 10: Keep Your List Warm**
- Give regular value through email, social media
- Use Dean Jackson's "9-Word Email": "Are you still looking to [4-word desire]?"
- No images, no frills, no links—just the question
- Examples: "...buy your dream home?" "...get more sales leads?" "...tone up your arms?"

### Benchmarks

- 1 in 5 contacts engage (20% response rate)
- 1 in 5 engagers take free offer (4 people per 100 outreaches)
- 1 in 4 free converts to paid (1 customer per 100 outreaches)

**Money Math**: 500 reach outs/week × 1% conversion × $400 product = $2,000/week = $104,000/year (2x median US household income)

### Limitations

1. **Time**: Need 4+ hours daily, first thing in morning
2. **List Size**: Eventually run out of people who know you (solution: build audience through content)

---

## Method #2: Post Free Content (Part I—Building Audience)

### How It Works

Say it once, reach many. Posting free content gets more engaged leads per unit of time than warm outreach. People who find it valuable become part of your warm audience. When they share it, their networks become part of your warm audience too—infinitely scalable.

**The Trade-Offs**:
- Less personalized (fewer respond)
- More competition (harder to stand out)
- People copy you (constant innovation required)

**The Upside**: Bigger audience = more engaged leads = more money

### The Content Unit: Hook-Retain-Reward

All audience-growing content rewards consumers. To get rewarded, they must:
1. Have reason to consume it
2. Pay attention long enough
3. Get that reason satisfied

**The Content Unit** is the smallest amount of material that hooks, retains, and rewards attention (can be as small as an image, meme, or sentence—all three can happen simultaneously).

### 1. Hook: Get Their Attention

Beat every alternative they have. Use three elements:

**Topics** (Five Categories):

**a) Far Past**: Important life lessons connected to your product/service
- Example: Friend showing 3 hours/day phone usage when complaining about "no time"
- Give the story without the scar

**b) Recent Past**: Talk about what you did/what happened
- Calendar meetings, client conversations, social interactions
- Example: Tweet from portfolio CEO meeting about copying competitors
- Take notes/recordings to create content stash

**c) Present**: Record ideas exactly when they come
- Always have recording method in arm's reach
- Post ideas publicly; high engagement = more content on that topic

**d) Trending**: Go where attention is
- Apply your experience/expertise to trending topics
- Very effective for broader audience reach

**e) Manufactured**: Turn ideas into reality
- Most time/effort but potentially biggest payouts
- Example: "I lived on $100 for a month. Here's how."

**Headlines** (Include at least two components):

- **Recency**: As recent as possible ("news")
- **Relevancy**: Personally meaningful to audience
- **Celebrity**: Prominent people/authorities
- **Proximity**: Geographically close to home
- **Conflict**: Opposing ideas, people, nature (pineapple on pizza?)
- **Unusual**: Odd, unique, rare, bizarre
- **Ongoing**: Stories in progress with plot twists

**Format**: Match popular content on the platform
- People consume content similar to what they've liked before
- Make your content look like what they expect will reward them
- Format for platform first, then tweak for your ideal audience

### 2. Retain: Keep Their Attention

**Curiosity** is the primary driver—embed questions in their minds.

**Three Methods**:

**a) Lists**: Items presented one after another following a theme
- Giving the number tells people what to expect
- Example: "7 Ways I Invested $1000 in My 20s That Paid Off Big"
- Example: "28 Ways to Stay Poor"

**b) Steps**: Actions in order that accomplish a goal
- Less flexible than lists but more explicit reward
- Must be done in specific order
- Example: "3 Steps to Creating a Great Hook"
- Example: "The Morning Routine That Boosts My Productivity"

**c) Stories**: Describe events (real or imaginary) with lessons/takeaways
- What happened, might happen, or will never happen
- People want to know what happens next
- Example: Almost every chapter in $100M Leads uses stories

**Power Move**: Interweave lists, steps, and stories (lists within steps, stories reinforcing steps, list of stories, multiple storylines, etc.)

### 3. Reward: Satisfy Their Curiosity

**Value per second** determines quality. No such thing as too long, only too boring (same person bored 3 seconds into 10-second video may binge 900-page book or 8-hour TV series).

**Increase reward probability by**:
- Hooking right audience (proper topics, headlines, format)
- Retaining with lists, steps, stories
- Clearly satisfying the hook's promise

**Bad Examples**:
- "7 Ways to Make Up with Spouse" but only give 4 ways
- Give 7 ways but they suck or audience has heard them
- Talking to wrong audience (making up with spouse to room of single guys)

**The Test**: Your audience decides. If audience grows, you're rewarding well. If not, practice more.

### Short vs. Long Form Content

**Short content**: Hook-retain-reward fewer times
**Long content**: Hook-retain-reward more times

Link content units together. A 5-step list might have each step as a content unit. String more units together for longer content.

**Best Practice**: Start small, build to longer. Short stories → epic novels.

## Method #2: Post Free Content (Part II—Monetize Audience)

### Master the Give:Ask Ratio

**Gary Vaynerchuk**: "Jab, jab, jab, right hook" (give many times before asking)

**Industry Standards**:
- TV: 47 min content: 13 min ads = 3.5:1 ratio (mature, focused on monetization)
- Facebook: 4 content posts: 1 ad = 4:1 ratio (mature, focused on monetization)

**Growing Platforms**: Give give give...give give give...maybe ask (dramatically over-give, under-ask to maximize growth)

**Hormozi's Twist: Give Until They Ask**

People wait for you to ask for money. When you don't, they trust more, share more—you grow faster. Eventually they feel uncomfortable receiving without giving back. They DM, email, ask for more.

**Benefits**:
- Get the best customers (biggest givers)
- Customers feel they get better end of deal
- Growth never slows
- Give in public, ask in private
- Let audience self-select when ready

**Bottom Line**: Starting to ask = deciding to slow growth. More patience = more return when you finally ask.

### Two Ask Strategies

**1. Integrated Offers**: Advertise in every piece while maintaining high give:ask ratio

Example: 1-hour podcast with 3× 30-second ads = 58.5 min giving: 1.5 min asking (well above 3:1)

**Warning**: Friend's podcast blew up, made offers too frequently in-content, podcast shrank

**Best Practices**:
- Integrate CTAs after valuable moments or end of content
- Monitor that audience growth doesn't slow

**2. Intermittent Offers**: Many pure "give" pieces, occasionally make "ask" piece

Example: 10 "give" posts, 11th promotes your stuff

**Platform Dependency**:
- Short platforms: intermittent dominates
- Long platforms: integration often best

**What to Promote**: Core offer or lead magnet (don't overcomplicate)

### Scaling Content Output

Hormozi went from 200k audience growth in 12 months posting regularly to 1.2M in 6 months by posting 10x more. Volume works. Content works.

**Influencer's advice**: "Anyone saying there's a secret is selling something. We just put out as much as we possibly can."

**Comparison**: Hormozi posted once/day. Influencer posted 3x/day on Instagram, 5x/day on LinkedIn—every platform showed same volume gap.

**Result**: 10x content = 10x audience growth

## Method #3: Cold Outreach

*(Section primarily references the same principles as warm outreach but applied to strangers—lists, personalization at scale, big fast value, high volume)*

---

## Method #4: Run Paid Ads

*(Complex section covering targeting, callouts, What-Who-When frameworks, CTAs, and client-financed acquisition—essentially buying cold traffic at scale and converting through Core Four principles)*

---

## Maximizing the Core Four: More Better New

Three ways to improve any of the four methods:

### More
- What keeps you from doing current activity at 10x volume?
- Solve for that constraint
- Do more until you hit next constraint

### Better
- Find the constraint in your advertising
- Test until you free the constraint
- Do more until constrained again

### New
- Test new audiences, placements, media types
- Expand to new platforms
- Add new Core Four activities

---

## Conclusion

The Core Four represent the complete universe of advertising possibilities. Mastery comes from doing all four, with sufficient skill and volume, consistently over time. Start with warm outreach and content (cheapest, most reliable), add cold outreach and paid ads as you gain resources and skills. More better new until you build your $100M Leads machine.
