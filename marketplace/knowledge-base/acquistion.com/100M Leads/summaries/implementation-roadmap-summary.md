# $100M Leads: Implementation Roadmap Summary

**Source**: Section V - Get Started

## The Core Operating Principle: You Either Win or You Learn

The defining mindset shift came at an eight-figure entrepreneur event where Hormozi learned: **Set aside a percentage of revenue (1-10%) to test new advertising approaches without expecting immediate returns.** This reframes "failures" as tuition paid for education that compounds forever.

**The Permission to Fail**: Testing, learning, and iterating rapidly builds skills faster than any course or program. Whether tests succeed (make money + learn) or fail (just learn), the education investment compounds eternally.

## Volume: The Non-Negotiable Foundation

**The 300 Flyers Lesson**: Hormozi put out 300 flyers, got zero results, and concluded flyers don't work. His mentor put out 5,000 flyers per day as a test size. Industry standard response: 0.5-1%. With 300 flyers, even 1% response = 1.5 people (impossible to know if it works).

**Critical Insight**: Most people dramatically underestimate required volume. They're not doing half or a third of what's needed—they're doing 1/50th or 1/1500th of the required effort.

**Common Mistake**: "I reached out to 100 people over six weeks, got one customer, it doesn't work." Reality: Required volume was 100 per day, not 100 over time (they did 1/42nd of required work).

**The Rule**: Advertising is an inputs-outputs game. Input advertising effort → Output engaged leads. Crystal clear on what to do (Core Four) and that you must do MORE and BETTER than before.

## Rule of 100 on Steroids: Open to Goal

**Rule of 100**: Commit to doing something a specific number of times (foundational discipline)

**Open to Goal**: Elite entrepreneur approach—commit to work until you hit specific number of outcomes, no matter what. Not just specific inputs (100 reps), but specific outputs (5 new members per day).

**Example**: Gym chain sales managers made own schedules with one rule—sign up 5 new members per day no matter what. If done by lunch, cut out early. If it took 18 hours, so be it.

**Power**: Unlocks whole new level of effort you never realized you had. Might mean 50 attempts or 5,000 attempts per day for years—whatever is required.

**The Shift**: Give up "doing your best." Instead, do what is required. Sometimes your best just needs to get better.

## Hormozi's High-ROI Habit Stack

Three habits that best served his success:

**1. Wake Up Early (4-5am)**
- Pro tip: This actually means going to bed early
- Magic isn't waking early—magic is long uninterrupted work after long uninterrupted sleep

**2. Get Right to Work**
- No rituals, no routines
- Drink coffee and get to work immediately

**3. No Meetings Until Noon**
- No interruptions, nothing
- Fully focused work time
- Most productive hours of most productive work with nothing in the way
- Every. Single. Day.

**Result**: 8+ hours of uninterrupted, high-value work daily before dealing with fires, humans, and day-to-day operations.

**Scaling the Habit**: If 12+ hour days feel overwhelming, throttle back a few hours and work up. Some days tough, but: "Do more than they do, and you will have more than they have."

## One-Page Advertising Plan

**Purpose**: Skip the 100-page plans that never get used. Harness power of single-page action plan with no room for excuses, distractions, or delusions. You either did it or you didn't.

**Five Steps**:

**Step #1: Pick the Type of Engaged Lead to Get**
- Customers
- Affiliates
- Employees
- Agencies

**Step #2: Pick Rule of 100 or Open to Goal**
- Commit to daily advertising actions
- Specify exact inputs (Rule of 100) or outputs (Open to Goal)

**Step #3: Fill Out Advertising Checklist for That Daily Action**
- Platform chosen
- Method chosen (which Core Four)
- Daily target (specific number)
- Success metrics

**Step #4: Do This Daily Action Until You Can Afford to Pay Someone Else to Do It**
- Execute consistently
- Track results
- Scale what works

**Step #5: When You Can Afford Help, Make Employees Your New Target Lead Type**
- Go back to Step 1
- Repeat Steps 1-4 to hire help
- Then scale again with more capacity

**Time to Complete**: 5 minutes to fill out checklist

**Outcome**: Naked truth staring back—all that's left is to do it

## The Seven-Level Advertising Roadmap

### Level 1: First Leads (Friends Know About You)
- Make one offer, to one avatar, on one platform
- Moment you get engaged leads = moment you can start making money
- Primary Action: Warm outreach (reach out to everyone you know)

### Level 2: Consistent Personal Capacity (Everyone You Know, Knows)
- Know exact inputs to get engaged lead with chosen method
- Scale inputs to get consistent customers
- Consistent customers come from maximizing personal work capacity
- Primary Actions: Max warm outreach + post as much content as consistently possible
- Note: Hormozi did paid ads with case study lead magnet, but recommends starting with free content

### Level 3: First Team Members (Employees Help Advertise)
- Maxed personal advertising inputs but not the platform
- Want more engaged leads = must do more = need help
- Primary Action: Hire people to advertise profitably on your behalf
- Example: Hormozi hired videographer and media buyer to handle paid ads work

### Level 4: Product-Market Fit (Consistent Referrals)
- Product good enough to get consistent referrals (25%+ of customers from referrals)
- Set up to ramp advertising again with more serious team
- Primary Actions: Focus on product until consistent referrals, then scale advertising with bigger team
- Critical: Most people mess up here by letting product slip and never recovering
- Hormozi discovered ads shut off but still getting referrals every week—doubled down on referrals, built goodwill through biweekly product updates based on customer feedback, started strong referral program

### Level 5: Multichannel Scale (More Places, More Ways, More People)
- Expand to new audiences on best platform
- Make ads with all placements and media types platform supports
- After team gets consistent results, expand to add another platform, lead getter type, or Core Four activity
- Primary Action: Advertise profitably using at least two methods on multiple platforms
- Example: Hormozi expanded paid ads to include potential affiliates, paving way for affiliate programs (two birds, one stone)

### Level 6: Executive Leadership (Killers Run Departments)
- Executives grow departments specific to advertising method/platform without you
- Not looking for potential—looking for experienced leaders specializing in exactly what you want
- Took Hormozi 3 years to realize: (1) Needed veteran executives with relevant experience (2) They needed stronger incentives
- After selling early companies and starting Acquisition.com, realized power of expanding the pie to get right people invested in winning
- Result: Crossed $100M+ then $200M+ in portfolio revenue
- Primary Action: Get battle-hardened executives and department heads to take over new advertising activities and channels

### Level 7: Beyond (To Be Written at $1B)
- Hormozi promises to update this chapter once he crosses a billion
- Will send lessons as soon as he has them

**Reality Check**: This looks clean. It never is. Real business is messy. Takes a lot of effort to find what audiences, lead magnets, methods, and platforms work best. Can only find out by trying—must try a lot of different things, a lot of different ways, for long enough time to know for sure.

**Certainty**: Nobody can know the absolute best thing to do. But this is certain: The more you advertise, the more people find out about your stuff. The more people who know, the more people will buy. This is the key to the $100M Leads Machine.

## The Hormozi Growth Story Timeline

**June 2017**: $400,000/month after switching to licensing model

**Testing-Driven Growth Sequence**:
- Tripled advertising budget after "permission to fail" epiphany
- $400K → $780K (tried new audiences, most failed, found hit)
- $780K → $1.2M → $1.5M (scaled winners)
- Realized not following up with engaged leads at all
- Tested email (didn't work) → phone calls (nothing) → text blasts (WHAM!)
- $1.5M → $1.8M (from text blast discovery)
- Tested paid ads like crazy, increased production value (BOOM!)
- Cruised past $2.5M/month
- Launched affiliate program, stacked $1.5M/month on top
- Passed $4M/month
- Years later: Portfolio does $16M+/month

**Pattern**: Test until you find something that works → Take massive action → Stay focused → Double down until it breaks → Test until you find next thing that works → Double down on that → Repeat

## The Many-Sided Die Parable

**The Game**: You and friend each get a die (one has 20 sides, one has 200 sides). Only one side is green on each die, rest are red. Goal: Roll green as many times as possible.

**Rules**:
- Can't see how many sides you have (only see red or green results)
- Roll green: One red side turns green, get to roll again
- Roll red: Nothing happens, get to roll again
- Game ends when you stop rolling (if you stop, you lose)

**What You Do**: Roll. Roll red, roll again. Others roll green, roll again. You roll green, roll again. Keep telling yourself: "The more I roll, the more greens I get." At first, green happens occasionally. As more red turns green, greens happen more. With enough rolls, hitting green becomes the rule, not exception.

**What Your Friend Does**: Rolls a few times, hits red each time. Sees you roll green, complains you must have die with fewer sides. Rolls a few more times in frustration, hits a green. Complains how long it took. Spends more time watching and complaining than playing. You hit your green streak. "It's so much easier for you! You get greens every time! This game is rigged!" He quits.

**The Truth**: Once you roll enough times, which die you're given doesn't matter.
- Die with fewer sides might roll green sooner
- Die with more sides might roll green later
- But a die with a green side always has a chance of rolling green... if you roll it
- Every die hits its green streak when rolled enough times

**Application**: All of us get a many-sided die. Looking at other players, you have no idea if it's their 100th roll or 100,000th. You don't know how "good" they were when they started, only how well they do now. But if you understand the game, it doesn't matter.

**The Only Two Guarantees**:
1. The more times you roll, the better you get
2. If you quit, you lose

**The Final Promise**: You cannot lose if you do not quit.

## Key Implementation Principles

**1. Test Allocation**: Set aside 1-10% of revenue for testing without expecting returns (education investment)

**2. Volume Requirements**: Most people underestimate by 10-50x. Find successful benchmarks in your industry and match or exceed them.

**3. Open to Goal**: Commit to outcomes, not just inputs. Work until the job is done.

**4. Uninterrupted Work Blocks**: Structure day for long stretches of focused, high-value work

**5. One-Page Planning**: Simple, clear, no excuses. Takes 5 minutes. Leaves nowhere to hide.

**6. Progressive Scaling**: Follow the seven levels sequentially. Don't skip steps. Each level builds foundation for next.

**7. Test → Scale → Break → Repeat**: Find what works, double down, scale until it breaks, find next thing

**8. Never Stop Rolling**: Keep testing, learning, iterating. More rolls = more greens = more success

## Timeline Expectations

**To $100M+ Revenue**: 5-10 years for those who know what to do. Building something great takes time even with perfect knowledge.

**Hormozi's Timeline**: 10+ years of best effort to cross first $100M in net worth with his wife.

**Mindset**: Bigger your goals, longer your time horizons need to be. Play games where if you wait, you win.

## Conclusion

Implementation isn't about secrets, hacks, or shortcuts. It's about volume, consistency, testing, learning, and never quitting. The roadmap is clear. The levels are defined. The only variable is how many times you're willing to roll the die. Do more than others do, do it longer than others will, learn faster than they can, and you'll have more than they have. Simple. Not easy. But simple.
