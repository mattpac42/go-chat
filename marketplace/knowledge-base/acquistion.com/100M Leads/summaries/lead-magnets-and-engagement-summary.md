# $100M Leads: Lead Magnets and Engagement Summary

**Source**: Section II - Get Understanding

## The Core Distinction: Leads vs. Engaged Leads

The framework establishes that **leads alone aren't enough**. While a lead is simply "a person you can contact," an engaged lead is "a person who shows interest in the stuff you sell." This distinction matters because:

- Raw leads (email lists, phone numbers, social followers) have minimal value without engagement
- Engaged leads are the true output of effective advertising
- Engagement indicates both problem awareness and potential buying intent

## Two Paths to Engagement: Core Offers vs. Lead Magnets

### Core Offers (Direct Path)

Advertising your main product/service directly—going straight for the sale. This works best for:
- Lower-priced products
- Simpler decisions
- Audiences with high awareness and intent

### Lead Magnets (Indirect Path)

A **lead magnet** is a complete solution to a narrow problem, typically lower-cost or free, that reveals another problem solved by your core offer. The salty pretzel analogy: pretzels solve hunger but reveal thirst (solved by buying drinks).

**Good lead magnets**:
- Are valuable enough you could charge for them
- Make people want more after consuming
- Get more engaged leads than core offers alone
- Cost less per engaged lead than direct selling
- Transform time-payers (now) into money-payers (later)

## The Seven-Step Lead Magnet Creation Framework

### Step 1: Figure Out the Problem and Avatar

Use the **Problem-Solution Cycle**: Every problem has a solution; every solution reveals more problems. Pick a narrow, meaningful problem that, when solved, reveals a new problem your core offer solves.

**Example**: Homeowners want to sell homes (broad). Narrow problems include: knowing home value, increasing value, professional photography, staging, etc. Solve one narrow problem free (home valuation), which reveals the larger problem (still need to sell), which you solve for money.

**Key Principle**: Smaller problem-solution cycles sit inside larger ones. Your lead magnet solves the small cycle; your core offer solves the big cycle.

### Step 2: Figure Out How to Solve It

Three types of lead magnets mapped to different prospect states:

1. **Reveal Problems** (Diagnosis): Make them aware of problems they don't know about, especially problems that worsen over time
   - Website speed tests, posture analysis, termite inspections
   - Draw clear lines between current state and ideal state
   - Show consequences of inaction

2. **Samples and Trials**: Give full but brief access to your core offer (limit uses, time, or both)
   - Works for recurring solutions to recurring problems
   - Server speed upgrades, chiropractic adjustments, consumables (Costco samples)
   - Create experience of the benefit, requiring continued purchase for continued benefit

3. **One Step of Multi-Step Process**: Give one valuable step free, rest when they buy
   - Works for complex solutions
   - This book (step 1 to $1M, then scaling beyond), free finance calculators (revealing complexity of DIY)
   - Show value while making remaining need obvious

### Step 3: Figure Out How to Deliver It

Four delivery mechanisms that work with all three types:

1. **Software**: Tools that do a job (spreadsheets, calculators, dashboards, small apps)
   - Example: Gym business stats dashboard comparing to industry averages

2. **Information**: Teach them something (courses, lessons, interviews, keynotes, case studies, tips)
   - Example: Mini-course on writing ads for gym owners
   - Hormozi's accidental discovery: case study video outperformed elaborate webinar

3. **Services**: Do work for free (audits, assessments, trials, transformations)
   - Example: Run gym ads free for 30 days
   - Example: Gym Launch model—fill gyms for free, keep first 6 weeks of membership fees

4. **Physical Products**: Tangible items they can hold (books, samples, tools, assessment charts)
   - Example: Gym Launch Secrets book for gym owners

**Power Move**: Create multiple versions (3 types × 4 delivery methods = 12 potential lead magnets for one narrow problem). Rotate them to keep advertising fresh while learning what resonates.

### Step 4: Test What to Name It

David Ogilvy: "When you have written your headline, you have spent 80 cents of your dollar." Five times more people read headlines than body copy. How you present the lead magnet matters more than the content.

**Testing Priority**:
1. Headline (most important)
2. Image(s)
3. Subheadline

**Hormozi's Book Title Testing Results**:
- "Leads" beat "Advertising" and "Marketing"
- Real image beat cartoon
- "How to get strangers to want to buy your stuff" dominated (note: adding "how to" and removing "more" both improved results)

**Testing Methodology**:
- Poll your audience (even small samples give directional data)
- Post on multiple platforms, ask for "1" or "2" responses
- Message people directly
- Bonus indicator: If people ask when they can get it, you have a mega winner

### Step 5: Make It Easy to Consume

People prefer less effort. Easier consumption creates 2-4x+ increases in take rates and completion.

**Format for Every Consumption Preference**:
- **Software**: Accessible on phones, computers, multiple formats
- **Information**: Video, text, audio, images—all formats (Hormozi's books: ¼ ebook, ¼ physical, ¼ audio, ¼ video)
- **Services**: More times of day, more days per week, video/phone/in-person options
- **Physical Products**: Simple to order, fast delivery, easy to open, intuitive directions (Apple-level: no directions needed)

**Power of Multi-Format**: $100M Offers split ¼-¼-¼-¼ across formats. Single format = missing 75% of potential engaged leads.

### Step 6: Make It Darn Good

**Give Away the Secrets, Sell the Implementation**

The marketplace judges everything—free or not. You cannot provide too much value; you can provide too little.

**Key Mindset Shifts**:
- If you're scared of giving away secrets, the alternative is giving away sucky fluff (making people think you suck)
- People buy based on expected future value
- Easiest way to raise expected future value: provide massive value before they buy
- 99% won't buy anyway—but they create or destroy your reputation based on free value

**The Standard**: Provide more value in your lead magnet than competitors' paid products. Make free stuff better than their paid stuff.

**Example**: A company scaling from $1M to $10M on free content alone becomes highly likely to partner when ready because value was pre-delivered.

### Step 7: Make It Easy for Them to Tell You They Want More

**Call to Action (CTA) Components**:

1. **What to Do**: Call, click, book, give information (clear, simple, direct language)
   - Not "don't delay" but "call now"

2. **Reasons to Do It Right Now**: Good reasons work better than bad; any reason works better than no reason

**Three Types of Reasons**:

**a) Scarcity** (limited amount relative to demand):
- Use reality: your actual limitations (capacity, inventory, time slots)
- Example: "Most convenient class times fill fast. Call now to get the one you want."
- Example: "I can only handle five people per week, so if you want it solved soon..."
- Creates ethical scarcity by advertising real constraints

**b) Urgency** (limited time):
- Unlimited units but short purchase window
- Less time = faster action
- Works for discounts or bonuses with deadlines
- Example: "July 4th promotion ends Monday at midnight"
- Example: "Black Friday promotion ends in 4 hours"

**c) Fraternity Party Planner** (make up a reason):
- Harvard study: People more likely to let others cut in line when any reason given
- Reason quality matters, but any reason > no reason
- Examples: "Because moms know best," "Because it's my birthday," "Because your country needs you"

**CTA Best Practices**:
- Don't be clever, be clear
- Do it often (throughout and at end of content)
- Combine multiple reason types for maximum effect

## The Lead Magnet Economics

**Example Comparison**:
- **Core Offer Only**: $1,000 ad spend per call, 1/3 close rate = $3,000 CAC on $10,000 profit = 3.33:1
- **With Lead Magnet**: $75 ad + $25 delivery = $100 per call, 1/10 close rate = $1,000 CAC on $10,000 profit = 10:1

**Result**: Lead magnet triples business for same ad budget by:
- Getting 10x more calls for same cost (free is easier to say yes to)
- Providing value in advance improves close rates
- CAC drops from $3,000 to $1,000

**Advanced Play**: Spend budget on lead magnet delivery ($25 vs. $0) to provide far more value than competitors, attracting more customers who close at higher rates because you pre-delivered value.

## Four Outcomes of Good Lead Magnets

1. Engages ideal customers when they see it
2. Gets more people to engage than core offer alone
3. Is valuable enough that they consume it
4. Makes the right people more likely to buy

## Conclusion

The lead magnet framework transforms advertising from "interrupt and pitch" to "attract and serve." By solving narrow problems exceptionally well for free, you build trust, demonstrate capability, and create moral obligation that converts engaged leads into customers at dramatically lower cost and higher lifetime value than traditional direct selling approaches.
