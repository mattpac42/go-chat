# $100M Leads: Lead Getters and Leverage Summary

**Source**: Section IV - Get Lead Getters

## The Leverage Principle

The $100M Leads machine fundamentally operates on leverage—getting more output for the same time input. An old lady can lift a semi-truck with a long enough lever while the strongest man cannot without one. In advertising, leverage means getting more engaged leads for less work by having other people do the Core Four on your behalf.

**Lead Getters** are people who let others know about your stuff using the Core Four methods. When others advertise for you, you save time while getting more engaged leads—this is leverage.

## The Four Leverage Scenarios

**Scenario #1: You Are the Lead Getter**
- You do the Core Four all day, every day by yourself
- Work: HIGH | Leads: LOW | Leverage: LOW
- Outcome: Enough leads to pay bills, maximum personal effort

**Scenario #2: You Get One Lead Getter**
- Lead getter does Core Four on your behalf
- Work: LOW | Leads: LOW | Leverage: HIGH
- Outcome: Same leads as scenario #1, but you work less

**Scenario #3: You Get Lots of Lead Getters**
- You spend all time recruiting lead getters
- Each new lead getter increases total leads
- Work: HIGH | Leads: HIGH | Leverage: HIGHER
- Outcome: Way more leads than solo, but requires constant recruitment work

**Scenario #4: You Get Lead Getters Who Get Lead Getters**
- Recruit someone who recruits others to advertise for you
- They get more lead getters every month without your involvement
- Work: LOW | Leads: HIGH (and growing) | Leverage: HIGHEST
- Outcome: The makings of a $100M Leads machine

## The Four Types of Lead Getters

### Lead Getter #1: Customer Referrals (Word of Mouth)

**How Referrals Work**: A referrer (typically a customer) sends an engaged lead to your business. This creates the lowest cost, highest profit, and best quality leads available.

**Why Referrals Matter**: They grow businesses in two ways:
1. **Higher LTGP**: Referrals buy more expensive products, buy more times, and pay cash upfront
2. **Lower CAC**: Free customers (from referrals) cost nothing to acquire

**The Referral Economics Example**:
- Without referrals: LTGP:CAC of 4:1 (use 25% of lifetime gross profit to get next customer)
- With referrals (every customer brings 2 more): LTGP:CAC of 12:1 (use 8.3% of LTGP to get next customer)
- Result: Get three customers for the price of one

**Exponential vs. Linear Growth**:
- Core Four: Linear relationship (double inputs = double outputs)
- Referrals: Exponential (one brings two, two bring four, four bring eight...)
- Equation: Referrals (in) - Churned Customers (out)
  - Referrals > Churn: Grow without other advertising
  - Referrals = Churn: Need other advertising to grow
  - Referrals < Churn: Must advertise to break even (most businesses)

**Why Most Don't Get Referrals**:
1. **Product Isn't Good Enough**: "Everyone loves our stuff, we just need to get the word out!" is what every small business owner says when their product isn't as good as they think
2. **They Don't Ask For Them**: Customers need to be told what to do

**The Goodwill Framework**: Price is what you charge. Value is what they get. The difference is goodwill. Lots of goodwill creates word of mouth. Two ways to build goodwill: lower price (temporary, limited effectiveness) or give more value (sustainable, unlimited potential).

**Six Ways to Get More Referrals By Giving More Value**:

**1. Call Outs → Sell Better Customers**
- Best customers get most value, have most goodwill, refer most
- Example: PR company plateaued serving generic small businesses, switched to niche (companies raising funding), broke through plateau, grew for first time in years
- Action: Find what successful customers have in common, target only those who meet criteria

**2. Dream Outcome → Set Better Expectations**
- Make product better than expected by setting lower expectations
- Underpromise, overdeliver strategy
- Action: Slowly lower promises until close rates drop, then stop—maximizes customers and goodwill

**3. Increase Perceived Likelihood → Get More People Better Results**
- Find what best customers did differently, force new customers to repeat those actions
- Gym Launch example: Customers who ran paid ads and made sale in first 7 days had 3x LTGP
- Process: Survey best customers → Interview them → Find common actions → Force new customers to repeat → Measure improvement → Match guarantees to success actions

**4. Decrease Time Delay → Make Faster Wins**
- Win = any positive customer experience
- Faster wins increase perception of speed, stickiness, and trust
- Five tactics: (1) Deliver seven small things at intervals vs. all at once (2) Updates are wins—share progress frequently (3) Force many wins in first 48 hours after purchase (4) BAMFAM: Book-A-Meeting-From-A-Meeting—they always know when they'll hear from you next (5) Add 50% to timelines to always deliver early

**5. Decrease Effort & Sacrifice → Keep Making It Better**
- No such thing as perfect product—can always improve
- Process: Find most common problem → Figure out fix using feedback from customers who succeeded despite problem → Improve product → Test with struggling customers → Get feedback → If solved, roll out; if not, iterate → Move to next most common problem
- Run this process monthly forever

**6. Call to Action → Tell Them What to Buy Next**
- Satisfied customers want more—if you don't sell them, they'll buy from someone else
- Sell them new thing or more of same thing
- Many customers who don't refer to first product will refer friends to second/third products
- Action: Treat every customer like first time selling them, make next offer more compelling, remind them to buy after each big win

**The One Question to Rule Them All**: "You've lost all customers but one. Advertising gods ban you from Core Four. All future customers must come from this one customer. How would you treat them? What results would they get? What onboarding would they experience? What type of customer would you pick?" Then do that for every customer.

**Asking for Referrals**: Treat referral asks like offers—show value customer gets when they refer friends.

**Case Studies**:
- **Dropbox**: Gave free storage to customers and referred friends, 39x'd business in 15 months
- **PayPal**: Gave $10 credit to customers and referred friends, reached 1M users in 2 years, 100M in 6 years

**Referral Program Framework** (based on value equation):
1. **Give Them Dream Outcome**: Cash, credits, products, discounts, exclusive access
2. **Increase Perceived Likelihood**: Make it easy to share, give templates/scripts, show how many people have already referred
3. **Decrease Time Delay**: Give rewards immediately when friend signs up (not when they buy)
4. **Decrease Effort & Sacrifice**: One-click sharing, pre-written messages, multiple sharing options

### Lead Getter #2: Employees

**How Employees Work as Lead Getters**: Employees execute the Core Four at scale on your behalf. This transforms your personal capacity constraint into a team capacity constraint.

**Evolution of Employee Leverage**:
- **Solo**: You max out personal capacity doing Core Four
- **Small Team**: Hire people to do specific Core Four activities (videographer, media buyer, content creator, outreach specialists)
- **Departments**: Build teams around specific methods (content department, paid ads department, affiliate department)
- **Executives**: Hire experienced leaders who build and run departments without you

**When to Hire Employees**:
- Level 3: Maxed personal advertising inputs but not the platform—hire to do more
- Level 4: Product good enough for consistent referrals—build bigger team to scale advertising
- Level 5: Advertise in more places, more ways, more people—expand team to add platforms/methods
- Level 6: Hire veteran executives with experience suited to your specific problems

**Critical Insight**: Employees multiply your personal capacity but require management, training, systems, and compensation structures that align incentives with outcomes.

### Lead Getter #3: Agencies

**How Agencies Work as Lead Getters**: Businesses with specialized services that get you leads. They bring expertise you don't have, speed up learning curves, and execute specific Core Four activities at professional level.

**When to Use Agencies**:
- Need specialized skills you don't have (media buying, content production, SEO, PR)
- Want to test new platform/method without hiring full-time
- Need to scale quickly without recruitment timeline
- Want to learn new skills before building in-house capability

**Agency Trade-Offs**:
- Higher cost per output than employees (but lower than learning curve time cost)
- Less control over execution details
- Temporary relationship vs. permanent team building
- Best for testing, learning, and temporary scaling

**Transition Path**: Many businesses use agencies to learn new advertising methods, then hire in-house teams once they understand what works and can manage execution.

### Lead Getter #4: Affiliates

**How Affiliates Work**: Businesses with existing audiences who tell their followers about your products in exchange for commission on resulting sales.

**Why Affiliates Are Highest Leverage**:
- They have audiences you don't (immediate access to new markets)
- They do all advertising work (you just provide offers, assets, and tracking)
- You only pay for results (performance-based, zero risk)
- They can recruit other affiliates (lead getters who get lead getters)

**Affiliate Value Equation**:
- **Dream Outcome**: High commissions, recurring revenue share, tiered bonuses for volume
- **Perceived Likelihood**: Easy signup, proven conversion rates, good affiliate support, timely payments, quality tracking
- **Time Delay**: Fast approvals, quick first commission, frequent payouts
- **Effort & Sacrifice**: Ready-made marketing assets, email templates, ad creatives, simple tracking links, dedicated affiliate manager

**Gym Launch Example**: Started affiliate program, stacked $1.5M/month on top of existing $2.5M/month in revenue, taking total past $4M/month.

**Affiliate Launch Process**:
1. Create compelling affiliate offer (high commissions, low barriers)
2. Build affiliate assets (swipe files, creatives, landing pages, email sequences)
3. Recruit initial affiliates using Core Four (warm outreach to customers/audience, content about affiliate program, cold outreach to potential affiliates, paid ads targeting affiliates)
4. Provide excellent affiliate support (tracking, reporting, payments, communication)
5. Identify top performers and give them more support/incentives
6. Create affiliate recruitment incentive (affiliates who recruit affiliates get override commissions)

**Integration Strategy**: Use affiliates to drive leads to your lead magnets, which feed your core offers, which create customers who become referrers and potential affiliates—the full leverage loop.

## The Leverage Multiplication Effect

**Core Four Alone**: Linear scaling (you do more, you get more)

**Core Four + Lead Getters**: Exponential scaling
- You do Core Four once to get customer
- Customer refers others (multiplier)
- You do Core Four once to get employee
- Employee does Core Four forever (multiplier)
- You do Core Four once to get agency relationship
- Agency executes at scale (multiplier)
- You do Core Four once to get affiliate
- Affiliate tells their audience forever (multiplier)

**The Ultimate Leverage**: Lead getters who get lead getters
- Customers who refer get rewarded for referring others who refer (Dropbox, PayPal models)
- Employees who recruit other employees (recruiting bonuses, team building)
- Agencies who refer other agencies (agency partnerships)
- Affiliates who recruit other affiliates (multi-tier commission structures)

## The $100M+ Lead Machine Vision

When fully assembled, your lead machine has:
- Ravenous customer base referring constantly
- Media teams scaling free content across all platforms
- Regular offers to warm audience converting customers and affiliates
- Teams running profitable paid ads across multiple platforms
- Cold outreach team generating customers
- Affiliate manager launching and integrating new affiliates
- Recruiters and agencies bringing in more lead getters
- Product so good 33%+ of customers bring more customers
- Executive team driving all growth without you

**Timeline**: For business owners who know what to do, building this takes 5-10 years. No overnight successes—just consistent, leveraged effort compounding over time.

## Conclusion

The shift from doing the Core Four yourself to getting others to do the Core Four for you represents the transition from small business to $100M+ leads machine. Customer referrals provide the highest quality leads at lowest cost. Employees scale your personal capacity. Agencies provide specialized expertise and learning. Affiliates provide highest leverage through existing audiences and performance-based risk.

The ultimate goal: build a system where lead getters recruit other lead getters, creating exponential growth that compounds month after month without requiring your direct involvement in execution.
