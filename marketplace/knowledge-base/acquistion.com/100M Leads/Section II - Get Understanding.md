Section II: Get Understanding
Advertising. Simplified.
In this section, we cover three things to make sure advertising does
exactly what we want it to do.
First, we talk about what a lead actually is. If we want more of
them, then we better be darn well sure we’re talking about the
same thing. Second, we learn how to separate leads that make you
money from leads that waste your time. Third, I show you the best
ways I know to get the leads that make you money to show interest
in the stuff you sell.
Let’s dive in.
Leads Alone Aren’t Enough
“If you cannot explain something in simple terms, then you don’t
understand it.”
- Dr. Richard Feynman, Nobel Prize Winner in Physics
I’ll let you in on a little secret. This book started because
somebody asked me what a lead was. You’d think it would be
simple, but I couldn’t give a straight answer. And after six months
of trying to figure it out, I was more confused than before. It
became clear I didn't know as much about leads as I thought. My
search for a clear definition of “a lead” snowballed into the
massive project that became $100M Leads. All this to say, we’ve
got to agree on what the heck a lead is before we dive head first
into getting them...
So what’s a lead anyways?
Someone who clicks an ad?
A phone number?
A person that schedules a call?
A list of names?
A door you knock on?
A walk-in?
An email address?
A subscriber?
A person that sees your content?
Etc…
You see, words matter because they affect how we think. How we
think affects what we do. And if words have us thinking the wrong
way, then we will probably do the wrong stuff. I hate doing the
wrong stuff. So to do the right stuff more and the wrong stuff less,
it’s best we know what words mean and use them.
To cut the suspense, a lead is a person you can contact. That’s all.
If you bought a list of emails, those are leads. If you get contact
information from a website or database, those are leads. The
numbers in your phone are leads. People on the street are leads. If
you can contact them, they are leads.
But what I came to realize was - leads alone aren’t enough. We
want engaged leads: people who *show* interest in the stuff you
sell. If someone gives their contact information on a website, that
is an engaged lead. If someone follows you on social media and
you can contact them, that is an engaged lead. If people reply to
your email campaign, they are engaged leads. The leads showing
interest are the leads that matter.
Engaged leads are the true output of advertising.
Getting more engaged leads is the point of this book. But I
couldn’t call the book “engaged leads” because no one would get
it. But now you do. So the next question is: How do we get leads to
engage?
Engage Your Leads: Offers and Lead Magnets
“I don’t do drugs. I am drugs” - Salvador Dali
April 2016.
I paid $25,000 to be in this group, and everyone told me to do a
webinar. In fact, my mentor at the time told me, “Do a webinar
every week until you make a million dollars. Until then, don’t ask
me about anything else.” This is my only path to success. I’ve got
to figure this out.
A webinar, as I understood it, was a magical presentation with a
zillion slides. If somebody watched, it would hypnotize them into
buying my thing.
There was so much I didn't know. Landing pages. Registration
pages. Follow-up emails. Replay emails. Cart close emails.
Presentation software. Website integration. Writing ads. Making ad
creative. Figuring out where to put the ads. Who to show the ads
to. Building a payment page. Processing payments. Never mind
making the actual webinar. The list overwhelmed me.
So, I started with what I understood most, the landing page. I built
a few of those for my gyms. My mentor made millions with
webinars, so I modeled his landing page. But I didn’t need it to
make millions. I just needed it to make something.
Okay...now the “thank you” page.
An entire Sunday later, the “thank you” page went live. Now for
the big test. I put my email into the landing page, clicked “sign me
up,” and waited. My brand new thank you page loaded. Success. I
still wasn’t a millionaire, sad face. But it was something.
The following Sunday, I sat down for my regular ‘work on the
business, not in the business’ ritual. I had ten hours to figure out
the next piece of this webinar puzzle. After my first cup of coffee, I
decided I didn’t really want to work, but I still wanted to feel
productive. So I went to my advertising group’s forum to get some
tips.
“Just got off my webinar. $32k in an hour! I ROI’d the entire
tuition in my first week! Webinars rock!”
I’m never gonna make this work. He joined the same month as me.
He was in the same industry as me. He figured out how to make
money with his webinar before me. He was stealing all the clients
before I even got a chance. Everyone is making money except me.
Desperate, I called other people in the group. “I will do anything
for your business: build a sales team… write your sales scripts…
fix your sales process… anything… just help me finish this
webinar…please?” One person agreed to help me. Thank God.
Eight Sundays later, and the little circle next to my ad campaign
turned green. It’s alive! I was officially spending $150 per day on
ads. All I had to do now was watch the money pour in. I was gonna
be rich!
Three days, $450, 80 leads, and 0 sales later…
I shut it all down. I suck.
No one even watched my webinar. Meanwhile, that guy posted
again about how much money he was making off this webinar
stuff. Why do I suck so much?
I spent most of my money to join this group, and I just set another
$450 on fire. I didn’t have the money to fail again. I needed the
next thing to work. And if I couldn’t even get anyone to watch,
what was the point?
The case study:
I scrolled my newsfeed to see what other people were doing. An ad
caught my eye. “Free Case Study on How I Spent $1 and Made
$123,000 in a Weekend” or something like that. I punched in my
email, and the page sent me to a video of walking through a
successful advertising campaign. Nothing fancy. No slides. No
“presenting.” Just a dude explaining how his stuff worked.
This, I can do.
I fired up my screen recorder:
Okay everyone. So here’s the ad account of a gym we just
launched. Here are the ads we ran. This is how much we spent. We
sent them to this page with this offer. You can see how many leads
we got here. They got this many people scheduled. This many
showed. This is how many they sold. This is how much the gym
owner made. This is everything we did. If you want help setting
something like this up, we’ll do the whole thing for free. And we
only get paid off the sales you make. If that sounds fair, book a
call.
It took maybe 13 minutes. Simple. I swapped the webinar out for
this video and changed the headline:
“FREE Case Study: How we added 213 members and $112,000 in
revenue to a small gym in San Diego.”
They would book a call on the next page.
I set up a fresh ad campaign and went to bed.
The next morning…
“Alex…what did you do?” Leila asked.
“What do you mean?”
“Strangers have booked my calendar solid for like the next week.”
“Really?”
“Yea. Did you start a new campaign or something?”
“Yea… but I didn’t think it would go live so fast. Wait. People
booked calls!?”
“Yea. Tons.”
Seeing Leila’s calendar stacked with appointments filled me with
joy. It’s working!
I learned an important lesson. They didn't want my webinar. But
they did want my case study. This accidental discovery showed me
how getting leads actually works…you have to give people
something they want. The best part is - it’s easier than you think.
Lead Magnets Get Leads to Engage
Offers are what you promise to give in exchange for something of
value. Often, a business promises to give its product or service in
exchange for money. This is a core offer. If you advertise your core
offer, then you go straight for the sale–the direct path to money.
Advertising your core offer might be all you need to get leads to
engage. Try this way first.
Sometimes, though, people want to know more about your offer
before they buy. This is common for businesses that sell more
expensive stuff. If that’s you, then you’ll often get more leads to
engage by advertising with a lead magnet first. A lead magnet is a
complete solution to a narrow problem. It’s typically a lower-cost
or free offer to see who is interested in your stuff. And, once
solved, it reveals another problem solved by your core offer. This is
important because leads interested in lower-cost or free offers now
are more likely to buy a related higher-cost offer later.
Think of it like salty pretzels at a bar. If somebody eats the
pretzels, they’ll get thirsty and order a drink. The salty pretzels
solve the narrow problem of hunger. They also reveal a thirst
problem solved by a drink, which they can get, in exchange for
money. The pretzels have a cost, but when done right, the drink
revenue covers the cost of the pretzels and nets a profit.
So your lead magnet should be valuable enough on its own that
you could charge for it. And, after they get it, they should want
more of what you offer. This gets them one step closer to buying
your stuff. A person who pays with their time now is more likely to
pay with their money later.
Good lead magnets get more engaged leads and customers than a
core offer alone, and do it for less money. So let’s make a lead
magnet, shall we?
Seven Steps To Creating an Effective Lead Magnet
Step 1: Figure out the problem you want to solve and who to solve it
for
Step 2: Figure out how to solve it
Step 3: Figure out how to deliver it
Step 4: Test what to name it
Step 5: Make it easy to consume
Step 6: Make it darn good
Step 7: Make it easy for them to tell you they want more
Something to keep in mind before we start - Grand Slam Offers
work for free stuff as much or better than they do for paid stuff. So
make your lead magnet so insanely good people will feel stupid
saying no. And yes, this means you may have a few insanely
valuable offers (even if some are free). But that’s a good thing. The
business that provides the most value wins. Period. So let’s get
started.
Step 1: Figure out the problem you want to solve and who to
solve it for
Here’s a simple example we can walk through together…this book
is a lead magnet. You are a lead. I want to solve an engaged lead
problem. And I want to solve it for businesses making less than
$1,000,000 in annual profit. With enough engaged leads, they can
make more than $1,000,000+ in annual profit. Then, they qualify
for my core offer: me investing in their company to help them
scale.
The first step is picking the problem to solve. I use a simple model
to figure this out. I call it the Problem-Solution cycle. You can see
it below.
Every problem has a solution. Every solution reveals more
problems. This is the never-ending cycle of business (and life).
And, smaller problem-solution cycles sit inside larger problemsolution
cycles. So how do we pick the right problem to solve?
We start by picking a problem that’s narrow and meaningful. Then,
solve it. And, like we just learned, when we solve one problem, a
new problem reveals itself. Here comes the important part- if we
can solve that new problem with our core offer, we’ve got a winner.
This is because we solve this new problem in exchange for money.
That’s it. Don’t overthink it.
Example: Imagine we help homeowners sell their homes. That is a
broad solution. But what about the steps before selling a home?
Owners want to know what their house is worth. They want to
know how to increase its value. They need pictures. They need it
cleaned. They need landscaping. They need minor things fixed.
They need moving services. They may need staging. Etc. These are
all narrow problems–great for lead magnets. We pick one of the
narrow problems and solve it for free. And although it helps, it
makes their other problem more obvious–they still have to sell
their home. But now we’ve earned their trust. So we can charge to
solve the remaining problems with our core offer and help them
achieve their broader goal.
Action Step: Pick the narrowly defined problem you want to solve.
Then, make sure your core offer can solve the next problem that
comes up.
Step 2: Figure out how to solve it
There are three types of lead magnets and each offers a different
type of solution.
First, if your audience has a problem they don’t know about, your
lead magnet would make them aware of it. Second, you could
solve a recurring problem for a short amount of time with a sample
or trial of your core offer. Third, you can give them one step in a
multi-step process that solves a bigger problem. All three solve one
problem and reveal others. So your three types are: 1) Reveal
Problems, 2) Samples and Trials, and 3) One Step Of A Multi-Step
Process.
1) Reveal Their Problem. Think “diagnosis.” These lead magnets
work great when they reveal problems that get worse the longer
you wait.
○ Example: You run a speed test that shows their website loads
at 30% below the speed it should. You draw a clear line
between where they should be and how much money they
lose by being below standards.
○ Example: You do a posture analysis and show them what their
posture should look like. You draw a clear line to what their
pain-free life would look like if their posture were fixed and
how you can help.
○ Example: You do a termite inspection that reveals what
happens when the bugs eat their home. If they do have
termites, you can get rid of them for cheaper than the cost
of… another home. If they don’t, they can pay you to prevent
the termites from coming to begin with! You can sell ‘em
either way. Win-win!
2) Samples And Trials. You give full but brief access to your core
offer. You can limit the number of uses, time they have access, or
both. This works great when your core offer is a recurring solution
to a recurring problem.
○ Example: You hook them up to your faster server and show
their website loading at lightning speed. They get more
customers from your faster load times. If they want to keep it,
they need to keep paying you.
○ Example: You give a free adjustment for their bad posture and
they experience relief. To get permanent benefits, they must
buy more.
○ Example: Food, cosmetics, medicine, or any other
consumables. Consumables, by nature, have limited uses and
solve recurring problems... with recurring use. So single
serving, “fun sized,” etc. samples are great lead magnets. It’s
how Costco sells more food than other stores–they give out
samples!
3) One Step Of A Multi-Step Process. When your core offer has
steps, you can give one valuable step for free and the rest when
they buy. This works great when your core offer solves a more
complex problem.
○ Example: This book. I help you get to $1,000,000+ per year
in profit. Then you’ll have new problems we can help you
solve, and scale from there.
○ Example: You give away a free wood sealant for a garage
door. But the sealing process requires three different coats to
protect from all weather conditions. I do the first one free,
explain how it only gives partial coverage, and offer the other
two in a bundle.
○ Example: You give away free finance courses, guides,
calculators, templates, etc. They are so valuable people really
can do it all themselves. But, they also reveal the time, effort,
and sacrifice of doing it all. So you offer financial services to
solve all that.
Action Step: Pick how you want to solve your narrowly defined
problem.
Step 3: Figure out how to deliver it
There are unlimited ways to solve problems. But my favorite lead
magnets solve them with: software, information, services, and
physical products. And each of those works great with the three
types of lead magnets from step two. I’ll show you what I’ve done
to attract gym owners using each lead magnet type.
1) Software: You give them a tool. If you have a spreadsheet,
calculator, or small software, your technology does a job for them.
Ex: I give away a spreadsheet or dashboard that gives a gym owner
all their relevant business stats, compares them to industry
averages, then gives them a rank.
2) Information: You teach them something. Courses, lessons,
interviews with experts, keynote presentations, live events,
mistakes and pitfalls, hacks/tips, etc. Anything they can learn from.
Ex: I give away a mini course for gyms on how to write an ad.
3) Services: You do work for free. Adjust their back. Perform a website
audit. Apply the first layer of garage sealant. Transform their video
into an ebook. Etc.
Ex: I run gym owner’s ads for free for thirty days.
4) Physical Products: You give them something they can hold in their
hands. A posture assessment chart, a supplement, a small bottle of
garage door sealant, boxing gloves to get boxing gym leads, etc.
Ex: I sell a book for gym owners called Gym Launch Secrets.
With three different types of lead magnets and four ways to deliver
them, that's up to twelve lead magnets that solve a single narrow
problem. So many magnets, so little time!
I make as many versions of a lead magnet as I can and rotate them.
This keeps the advertising fresh and low effort. Plus, you see
which ones work best. Like my case study story at the beginning of
the chapter, the results are often surprising. And you won’t know
until you try.
Action Step: As a thought exercise, think of a lead magnet and
then a version of it for each delivery method. You always can, I
promise. Then, pick how to deliver your lead magnet.
Step 4: Test What To Name It
David Ogilvy said, “When you have written your headline, you
have spent 80 cents of your (advertising) dollar.” What that means
is, five times more people read your headline than any other part of
your promotion. They read it and make a snap decision to read
further… or not. Like Ogilvy hints, leads have to notice your lead
magnet before they can consume it. Like it or not, this means how
we present it matters more than anything. For example, improving
the headline, name, and display of your lead magnet can 2x, 3x, or
10x your engagement. It’s that important. Besides, if no one shows
interest in your lead magnet, no one will ever know how good it is.
You can’t leave it to chance. So listen up. Here’s what you do next
- you test.
The three things you’ll want to test are the headline, the image(s),
and the subheadline, in that order. The headline is the most
important. So if you only test one thing, test that. For example, I
had no idea what to title this book. So here’s what I did to figure
out which name would do the best - I tested. The results may
surprise you as much as they surprised me.
Headline Tests
Round I: Advertising ✔ vs. Promotion
Round II: Advertising vs. Leads ✔
Round III: Marketing vs. Leads ✔
Image Test
✔ Real vs. Cartoon
Subheadlines
Round I:
“How to get more people to want to buy your stuff”
“How to get strangers to want to buy your stuff” ✔
Round II:
How to get more strangers to want to buy your stuff”
“How to get strangers to want to buy your stuff” ✔
Round III:
“How to get as many leads as you darn well please”
“How to get strangers to want to buy your stuff” ✔
Round IV:
“Get strangers to want to buy your stuff”
“How to get strangers to want to buy your stuff” ✔
Note two things with the subheadline tests:
1) “How to get strangers to want to buy your stuff” overwhelmingly
beat “Get strangers to want to buy your stuff.” The only difference is
two little words: “how to.” And it also beat “how to get more
strangers to want to buy your stuff” with a single word removed
‘more.’ Small changes can make big differences.
2) Since so many people asked, I figured I’d answer it here. I didn’t
subtitle the book “How to get strangers to buy your stuff” because
that’s sales, not getting leads. The point of this book is to get
strangers to show interest, not to buy (yet). A raised hand is where
this book ends. ‘$100M Sales’ or 'Persuasion' (I haven't decided yet)
will be a future book. One problem at a time.
Action Step: Test. If people engage in droves, you’ve got a winner.
And if you have any following at all, you can run polls like these.
You don't need a lot of votes to get a directional idea. If you can’t
do that, make a post on every platform and ask people to respond
with a ‘1’ or a ‘2’, then count ‘em up. If you still can’t even do
that, then just message people and ask. There’s always a way, and
this is one of the highest leverage things you can do with your time
- make sure how you package it gets engagement and you give
yourself a big head start.
Bonus Points: If people respond to the poll and ask when they can
get their hands on it, you have a mega winner.
Step 5: Make it easy for them to consume
People prefer to do things that take less effort. So if we want more
people to take us up on our lead magnet, and consume it, we gotta
make it easy. You can see 2x, 3x, and even 4x+ increases in take
rates and consumption simply by making it easier to consume.
1) Software: You want to make it accessible on their phones, on a
computer and in multiple different formats. This way, they’ll pick
the one easiest for them.
2) Information: People like to consume things in different ways. Some
people like watching, other people like reading, others like
listening, etc. Make your solution in as many different formats as
you can: images, video, text, audio, etc. Offer them all. That’s why
this book comes in every format people consume.
3) Services: Be available at more times in more ways. More times of
day. More days of the week. Via video call, phone call, in person,
etc. The easier you are to get a hold of, the more likely people will
become engaged leads to claim the free value.
4) Physical products: Make it super simple to order and fast to get to
them. Make the product itself fast and easy to open. Give simple
directions on how to use the product. Example: Apple made its
products so well they didn’t even need directions. And the
packaging is so good, most people keep the boxes.
Action Step: Package your lead magnet in every way you can. It
dramatically increases how many engaged leads come your way.
And more leads engaging with your lead magnet means more leads
getting value from it. This is huge.
Fun fact: My book $100M Offers has a near perfect ¼, ¼, ¼, ¼
split between ebooks, physical books, audiobooks, and videos (free
on Acquisition.com). Making the book available in multiple
formats is the easiest way I know to get 2-3-4x the amount of leads
for the same work. If I only made it available in one format, I’d
miss out on the 3-4x the people who wouldn’t have read the book
otherwise. What a shame that would’ve been and what a waste.
Step 6: Make it darn good:
Give Away The Secrets, Sell The Implementation
The marketplace judges everything you have to offer - free or not.
And you can never provide too much value. But, you can provide
too little. So you want your lead magnet to provide so much value
people feel obligated to pay you. The goal is to provide more value
than the cost of your core offer before they’ve bought it.
Think about it this way. If you’re scared of giving away your
secrets, imagine the alternative: You give away sucky fluff. Then,
people who might've become customers think this person sucks!
They only have sucky fluff! Then, they buy from someone else. So
sad. Not only that, they tell other folks who might’ve bought from
you, not to. It’s a vicious cycle you don’t want to ride.
But remember, people buy stuff based on how much value they
think they’ll get after they buy it. And the easiest way to get them
to think they’ll get tons of value after they buy is… drum roll
please… to provide them with value before they buy.
Imagine a company scaled from $1M to $10M just by consuming
my free content. The chance they’ll partner with Acquisition.com
is huge because I paid for my share before we even started.
Action Step: 99% of people aren’t gonna buy, but they will create
(or destroy) your reputation based on the value of your free stuff.
So, make your lead magnets as good as your paid stuff. Your
reputation depends on it. Provide value. Stack the deck. Reap the
rewards.
Step 7: Make it easy for them to tell you they want more
Once the leads consume the lead magnet, some of them will be
ready to buy or learn more about your offer. This is the time to give
a Call To Action. A Call To Action (CTA) tells the audience what
to do next. But, there’s a little more to it than that. At least, if you
want your advertising to work. Good CTAs have two things: 1)
what to do and 2) reasons to do it right now.
What to do: CTAs tell the audience to call the number, click the
button, give information, book the call, etc. There are way too
many to list. Just know CTAs tell the audience how to become
engaged leads. Good CTAs have clear, simple, and direct language.
Not “don’t delay” but instead “call now.” Read the next paragraph
to learn more (see what I did there?).
Reasons to do it right now - If you give people a reason to take
action, more people will do it. But a couple things to keep in mind:
first, good reasons work better than bad reasons. And second, any
reason (even bad ones) tends to work better than no reason at all.
So to get more people to take action, I include as many effective
reasons as I can. Here are my favorite reasons to act now:
a) Scarcity- Scarcity is when there is a limited amount of something.
Especially when there is a small supply compared to demand. When
something is scarce, like your lead magnet or offer, people also tend
to want it more. And this is why they’re more likely to act right now.
The fewer you have, the more valuable people think it is. But there’s a
catch- the fewer you have, the fewer engaged leads you can get before
running out. So the best strategy I know for scarcity is - reality. Let
me explain. If you sold 1000x the customers tomorrow, could you
handle it? If not, you have some limit to how much you can sell.
Maybe you’re limited by customer service, onboarding, inventory,
time slots per week, etc. Don’t keep it a secret - advertise it. This
gives you ethical scarcity. If you can’t handle more than five new
customers per week, say so. Draw attention to the natural scarcity in
your business. If you have limitations you may as well use them to
make money.
Ex: “The most convenient class times fill up fast. Call now to get the
one you want.”
“I can only handle five people per week, so if you want it solved
soon, do xyz…”
“We only printed one batch of shirts and will never reprint this
design, get one so you don’t regret missing out forever…”
b) Urgency. You can have unlimited units to sell, but let’s say you stop
selling them in an hour… on purpose. I bet more people than normal
will buy your thing in that hour. This is urgency in action. Urgency is
when people act faster because they have a short amount of time.
And the less time people have, the faster (more urgent) they tend to
act. So if you make the time they can act on your CTA shorter, you
can get more of them to act on it faster. You can also use the same
urgency with discounts or bonuses that go away after X minutes or
hours. After which, this offer will never be available again.
Ex: “Our July 4th promotion ends Monday at midnight, so if you want
it, take action now.”
“Our Black Friday promotion ends at midnight. There are only
four hours left. Get it while the gettin’s good.”
“Through Friday, I’ll also throw in a free hat to anyone who buys
more than three books. So if you wanna look slick in an
Acquisition.com hat, buy now.”
c) Fraternity Party Planner (my favorite) - Make Up A Reason.
Fraternities don’t need a reason to party - but they sure make up some
doozies. “John got his wisdom teeth removed…kegger!” “Margherita
Monday!” “Toga Tuesdays” “Thirsty Thursday!” etc. Your reason
doesn’t even have to make sense, and it will still get more people to
act. In fact, Harvard ran an experiment showing that people were
more likely to let someone cut in line if they only gave a reason. The
number of people that let others cut increased if the reason made
sense (like scarcity and urgency). But any reason still works better
than no reason. So I always try to include one. Think ‘the stuff you
say’ after the word because. Examples:
● Because…moms know best.
● Because…your country needs you.
● Because…it’s my birthday, and I want you to celebrate with me.
Action Step: Give a clear, simple, action-oriented CTA. Then, give
them a ‘reason why’ using scarcity, urgency, and any other reasons
you can think of. And, do it often. Don't be clever, be clear.
Even if your lead magnet costs money to deliver, it should still
lower your cost to get a new customer. This is because more
engaged leads means more chances to get customers. And the extra
customers more than cover your costs. That’s the point.
Let’s say you make $10,000 of profit on your core offer. And it
costs you $1000 in advertising to get someone on a call for it. If
you close one out of three people, it costs you $3000 in advertising
to get a customer. Since we have $10,000 in profit to work with,
that’s fine. But we’re savvy, we can do better. So, let’s do better.
Imagine you advertise a free lead magnet instead of your core
offer. Your lead magnet costs you $25 to deliver, and because it’s
free to them, more will engage. The extra engagement means it
only costs $75 in advertising to get someone on a call. All in, it’s
$100 per call. By delivering value before they buy, you get ten
times more engaged leads for the same cost. Note: this happens all
the time when you nail the lead magnet.
Now, let’s say one out of ten folks who get the lead magnet buys
your core offer. This means your new cost to acquire a customer is
$1000 ($100 x 10 people). We just cut our cost to get a customer
by 3x. So instead of spending $3000 to get a new customer, by
using a lead magnet, we spend only $1000. Given we make
$10,000, that’s a 10:1 return. So if we keep our advertising budget
the same, and use a lead magnet, we triple our business.
Remember: the goal is to print money, not just make our “fair
share.”
This is where experienced business owners beat newbies. With a
$25 budget to deliver your lead magnet, you can provide FAR
more value than a $0 budget. Crazy, I know. You attract more
customers because your lead magnet is more valuable than other
people’s. Oftentimes, by a lot. This translates into more strangers
becoming engaged leads. It also translates into more sales because
you provided value in advance. Win. Win. Win.
Action Steps:
Step 0: If you’re struggling to get leads, make an amazing lead
magnet.
Step 1: Figure out the problem you want to solve for the right
customer
Step 2: Figure out how you want to solve it
Step 3: Figure out how to deliver it
Step 4: Make the name interesting and clear
Step 5: Make it easy to consume
Step 6: Make sure it’s darn good
Step 7: Tell them what to do next, why it's a good idea, do it
clearly, and do it often
Section II Conclusion
My goal with this book is to demystify the lead-getting process. In
the first chapter, we covered why leads alone aren’t enough–you
need engaged leads. In the second chapter, we covered how to get
leads to engage - a valuable lead magnet or offer. And a good lead
magnet does four things:
1) Engages ideal customers when they see it.
2) Gets more people to engage than your core offer alone
3) Is valuable enough that they consume it.
4) Makes the right people more likely to buy
So, more people show interest in our stuff. We make more money
from them. And we deliver more value than we ever have–all at
the same time.
Next Up:
We’ve armed ourselves with a powerful lead magnet. Now, I’ll
show you the four ways we can advertise it. In other words, now
that we have “the stuff,”–we gotta tell people about it. Let’s get
some leads.
