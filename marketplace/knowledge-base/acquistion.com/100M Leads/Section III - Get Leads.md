Section III: Get Leads
The Core Four Advertising Methods.
We get engaged leads by letting people know about our stuff. And
there are two types of people we let know: people who know us
and people who don’t. And there are two paths of letting them
know about it: one-to-one and one-to-many. Those combine into
the four basic ways one person can let other people know about
anything. Let’s break down how we can use those four ways to get
us leads.
Two Types of Audiences: Warm and Cold
Warm audiences are people who gave you permission to contact
them. Think “people who know you” - aka - friends, family,
followers, current customers, previous customers, contacts, etc.
Cold audiences are people who have not given you permission to
contact them. Think “strangers” - aka - other peoples’ audiences:
buying contact lists, making contact lists, paying platforms for
access, etc.
The difference matters because it changes how we advertise to
them.
Two Ways To Communicate: One to One (Private), One to
Many (Public)
We can contact people 1-to-1 or 1-to-many. Another way of
thinking about this is private or public communication. Private
communication is when only one person gets a message at a time.
Think “phone call” or “email.” If you announce something
publicly, many people can get it at the same time. Think “social
media posts” or “billboards” or “podcasts.”
Now, automation can make this seem confusing. Don’t let it.
Automation just means some of the work is done by machines. The
nature of the communication stays the same. Email, for instance, is
one-to-one. Emailing a 10,000 person list “once” is more like oneto-
one really fast by a machine. Automation, which we cover later,
is one of the many ways we can get leads on steroids. Like
audiences, the difference between public and private
communication matters because they change how we advertise.
Section III Outline: Get Leads
Combining warm and cold audiences with 1-to-1 and 1-to-many
leads us to the only four ways we can let anyone know about
anything: the core four. I combined them below for you.
1-to-1 to a Warm Audience = Warm Outreach
1-to-many to a Warm Audience = Posting Content
1-to-1 to a Cold Audience = Cold Outreach
1-to-many to a Cold Audience = Paid Ads
These are the only four things you can do to let other people know
about the stuff you sell. And each method takes us one step closer
to the land of overflowing leads. I refer to the core four throughout
the rest of the book - so get to know them. In fact, make them part
of yourself.
Once you do, you will have your own “get out of jail free” card to
carry around forever. It will give you as many chances to succeed
at business as you could ever want for the rest of your life. Or at
least, it has for me.
So if you aren’t getting as many leads as you want, you’re not
doing the core four with enough skill or with enough volume. We
cover all this stuff in lots of detail. How they work. How to do
them. When to do them. And show how to measure your progress
along the way. This simplifies the overly confused world of
advertising into four core actions. Either do them and get as many
leads as you darn well please, or get crushed by those who do.
#1 Warm Outreach
How To Reach Out To People You Know
“The world belongs to those who can keep doing without seeing
the result of their doing.”
May 2013. Starting out.
For the third time that day, I pulled out my phone and checked my
bank account. $51,128.13. I let out a small sigh of relief. It’s
amazing how years of work and saving can fit into such a tiny
screen. Feeling good for the moment, I switched over to social
media to get more dopamine. Friends from college were applying
to business school. Acceptance letters filled my newsfeed. I, too,
started the business school application process.
I had a choice: I could either quit my job and go to business
school, or I could quit my job and start a business.
The application stared at me - How will a Harvard MBA help your
short and long-term goals?
That question changed my life. I spent three days trying to answer
it. At the end of the third day, I saw the truth - it wouldn’t.
$150,000 in loans and two years without income wouldn’t help me
start a business. At least not as much as starting a business and
taking two years to figure it out. I could make the same amount by
the time I graduate and skip the debt. Or at least, that’s what I told
myself.
So I quit my job and took the steps to start my business. I set up
Impetus Group LLC. Check. I set up a business banking account.
Check. I set up a merchant account to process payments. Check.
There still wasn’t any money coming in, but at least I felt ‘legit.’
Impetus Group LLC. (say it out loud...)
The first person I told about my new business said, “Impotence?”
God, I suck. No wonder the name was available. I immediately
changed it to ‘The Free Training Project.’ Name that doesn’t suck?
Check. I was in business.
But I had a problem - I didn’t know anything about advertising or
sales. But I did know I needed clients. So, I just asked around
where I could. I called, texted, and sent Facebook messages to a
bunch of people I knew.
“Hey, do you know anyone who’s trying to get into shape? I'm
training people for free for twelve weeks. On top of that, I'll make
them a custom nutrition plan and grocery list. All they have to do
is donate to a charity of their choice and let me use their
testimonial.”
Only six people said yes. Six. Two high school friends. One
college friend. And three people they referred.
I emailed everyone fitness plans and we got to work. We texted
during the week to keep tabs on progress. Thankfully, they were all
friends of mine, so they gave it their all. They encouraged me more
than anyone in the beginning. A decade later, I still have their
before and after pictures.
And this is where the decision to skip business school started
coming back to haunt me. A few months into this, I was less sure
of myself. My ‘pile’ of money didn’t look as big without new
money coming in every month. And it started turning into a real
problem. So, after twelve weeks of the “pay a charity period,” I
asked them to pay me instead. I was the charity now. Ha. I worried
they’d be upset to pay me instead, but they didn’t seem to mind.
Once they got results, I asked them to send their friends over. To
my surprise, I got another five or six clients from their referrals. I
asked the referrals to pay me directly. Again, none of them minded.
That little business made about $4000 per month and replaced the
income from my first job. It gave me enough money to live on (and
some). My savings started to grow again. Sigh of relief.
If this business sounds straightforward, that’s because it was. I
emailed clients their plans and they texted me the questions they
had along the way. That’s about it.
So if you’re starting, you don’t need a lot. All you need is a tax ID,
a bank account, a way to take payments, and a way to
communicate with people.
But, that last part - a way to communicate with people - is the most
important part. It's how you get leads. So even though I had no
idea I was doing warm reach outs, one of the core four, it’s how I
got my first leads. I still get leads this way (just with bigger
numbers). And I’ll show you how you can too.
How Warm Reach Outs Work
Warm reach outs are when you make one-to-one contact with your
warm audience - aka - the people who know you. It’s the cheapest
and easiest way to find people interested in the stuff you sell. It’s
super effective–and most businesses don’t do it. Don’t be like most
businesses. Also, you do have a warm audience, even if you don’t
know it. Everybody knows somebody. So your personal contacts
are the easiest place to start.
Warm reach outs usually come in the form of calls, texts, emails,
direct messages, voicemails, etc. And like we learned in Section II,
you advertise one of two things. You let them know about your
lead magnet (something free and valuable), or you let them know
about your core offer (the main thing you sell).
When you start doing warm reach outs, you don’t get many
engaged leads for your time. You do everything on your own and
make each message personal. But, for that reason, it is reliable. As
certain as the sun rises and sets, it works.
Note: Reaching out to your warm audience works whether you
have 100 contacts or 1,000,000. So as your business grows, you
will use automation and employees to make it more efficient. The
systems start small, with you, but they scale all the way up. I detail
how to scale these systems to larger audiences in Section IV.
How To Do Warm Reach Outs in 10 Steps
Warm reach outs are a fantastic way to get your “First Five
Clients” For any new product or service. Advanced Folks: Think
re-engagement and new product lines. Here’s how to do it:
Step 1: Get your list
Step 2: Pick a platform
Step 3: Personalize your message
Step 4: Reach out
Step 5: Warm them up
Step 6: Invite their friends
Step 7: Make them the easiest offer in the world
Step 8: Start at the top
Step 9: Start Charging
Step 10: Keep Your List Warm
(Step 1) “But I don’t have any leads…” → Everyone Has A
List
You know other humans. Let me prove it to you.
Grab your phone. Inside you have contacts. Each contact has
subscribed to communication from you. They have given you the
means and permission to contact them.
Pull up all the email accounts you’ve used over the years. Pull
your contacts and address list from each. Bingo! Look at all
them leads.
Now, go to all your social media profiles. See your followers,
subscribers, friends, connections, or whatever kids call ‘em
these days...eureka – you got more leads!
Add up all your contacts from all the platforms. Seriously, figure
out the number. Between your phone, email, social media, and
other platforms you will have more than enough contacts to get
started. For many of you, this will be your first 1000 leads. Would
ya look at that! “I don’t have any leads.” Psh. Just found some.
And if you’re terrified you’ll have to talk to people. Relax. You’ll
like what I’m gonna show you next.
(Step 2) “But I don’t know where to start…” → Pick A
Platform
Pick the platform you have the most contacts on. Phone, email,
social media, mail, carrier pigeon, etc. It doesn’t matter. Just pick
the one with the most contacts. You’ll hit ‘em all eventually
anyways.
(Step 3) “But what do I say?” → Personalize your greeting
Use something you know about the contact as your actual reason to
reach out. If you don’t have much personal info, you can check
their social media profiles etc. to learn a bit about them first.
Don’t be a weirdo. Pay your social dues. Remember, you haven’t
asked for anything. You’re just checking in and providing value.
So…relax.
Ex: Saw you just had a baby! Congrats! How is the baby doing?
How are you?
(Step 4) “Now what?” → Reach. Out. To. One. Hundred.
People. Every. Day.
“To get what you want, you have to deserve what you want.” -
Charlie Munger
Now, reach out to 100 of them per day with your personalized
messages. You’ll call, text, email, message, send a postcard, etc.
And you will reach out to them up to three times. Once per day for
three days* or until they respond. Whichever comes first.
*Once per week with physical mail.
(Step 5): “What do I say when they respond?” → Act like a
human.
Now we can break the ice without sounding icky.
Reply using the A-C-A framework:
Acknowledge what they said. Restate it in your own words. This
shows active listening.
Ex: Two kids. And you’re an accountant…
Compliment them on whatever they tell you. Tie it to a positive
character trait if you can.
Ex: …Wow! Supermom! So hardworking! Managing a
full-time career and two kids...
Ask another question. Lead the conversation in whatever
direction you want. In this case, to a topic closer to your offer.
Examples:
Therapy/Life Coaching: …Do you get time for yourself?
Fitness/Weight Loss: ...Do you have time to get workouts
in?
Cleaning Services: ...Do you have anyone who helps you
keep the house tidy?
The ACA framework is great because it helps you talk to anyone.
It just so happens it’s also useful for letting people know about
your stuff. This means you can learn about the person and guide
the conversation toward your offer.
People love talking about themselves. So let them. They also love
to be complimented, so do that too. And if people feel good when
talking to you, they’ll like and trust you more. You want people to
like and trust you more. Besides, it’s solid practice to find the good
in everyone anyway. Speaking of practice, this will take practice.
And that’s OK.
(Step 6) “How do I know if they’re interested?” → Make them
an offer.
Get through a ‘normal’ amount of conversation. Think 3-4
exchanges if on the phone or messaging and 3-4 minutes if in
person. Then, you’ll make them an offer to see if they’re
interested.
When I make an offer from scratch, I refer to the value equation. If
you’re wondering ‘what’s the value equation?’ - it was the core
concept of my first book $100M Offers. Value, as I define it, has
four elements:
1) Dream Outcome: what the person wants to happen, the way they
want it to happen
State the best possible results your product can get. Big bonus
points if those results come from people like the one you’re
talking to.
2) Perceived Likelihood of Achievement: how likely they think it
is for them to achieve their goal
Include results, reviews, awards, endorsements, certifications,
and other forms of 3rd party validation. Also, guarantees are
huge.
3) Time Delay: how long they believe it’ll take to get results after
they buy
Describe how fast people start getting results, how often they
get results when they start, and how long it takes to get the best
results possible.
4) Effort and Sacrifice: The bad stuff they'll have to endure and the
good stuff they'll have to give up in their struggle to get the result.
Show them the good stuff they can keep doing, or get to do, and
still get results. And show them the bad stuff that they can get
rid of, or avoid doing, and still get results.
The goal is to maximize the first two and minimize the second two.
So all you have to do now is show someone:
You have exactly what they want
They’re guaranteed to get it
Insanely fast
Without lifting a finger or giving up anything they love
No biggie, right? Obviously, that’s ideal. We gotta get as close to
that as we can without lying or exaggerating.
So let’s do just that with a real-life offer:
...By the way, do you know anybody who is (describe their
struggles) looking to (dream outcome) in (time delay)? I’m taking
on five case studies for free, because that’s all I can handle. I just
want to get some testimonials for my service/product. I help them
(dream outcome) without (effort and sacrifice). It works. I even
guarantee people get (dream outcome) or I work with them until
they do. I just had a girl named XXX work with me (dream
outcome) even though she (describe the same struggle your contact
has). I also had another guy who (dream outcome) and it was his
first time. I’d just like more testimonials to show it works across
different scenarios. Does anyone you like come to mind? (Pause if
on the phone) …and if they say no…Haha, well…does anyone you
hate come to mind? (ha) This helps break any awkwardness.
There’s an important feature here. We’re not asking them to buy
anything. We’re asking if they know anyone. And of the people
who say yes, most say they are interested. This entire thing is
engineered to boost their perceived likelihood of achievement. It’s
why we show struggles and results from people like them who
have struggles like theirs. But, we let them connect the dots. Since
you didn’t ask them to buy anything, you don’t come off as pushy.
Some people will show interest in your stuff. Some will refer you
to those who might. Some will do both. In all three outcomes, you
win. And you win without pushing anything on anyone.
If you have even less time or space to deliver it, just use the value
elements back to back:
I help (ideal customer) get (dream outcome) in (time period)
without (effort and sacrifice) and (increase perceived likelihood of
achievement–look at the pro tip below).
Note: These work well for emails, texts, direct messages, calls, and
in-person. Just fill in the blanks.
(Step 7) “How do I get them to say yes?” → Make it easy for
them to say yes. Make it free.
After people show interest, make your offer easy to say yes to. I
like to start with the easiest offer enhancer in the world - FREE:
And don’t try to look advanced if you’re not. People aren’t dumb.
Just be honest and keep it simple:
Since I’m only taking on five people, I can give you all the
attention you need to get brag-worthy results. And I’ll give it all
for free so long as you promise to: 1) Use it 2) Give me feedback
and 3) Leave a killer review if you think it deserves one. Does that
sound fair?
This sets reasonable expectations upfront. And boom. Now, you’re
just helping people for free. Winning.
My recommendation - whenever you launch a new product or
service - make the first five free. The exact number matters less
than knowing why you benefit from it. Here’s why:
1. You get the reps in and become comfortable with making offers
to people. It’ll calm your nerves knowing you’re just helping…
for free…for now (winky face).
2. You probably suck (for now). People are far more forgiving
when you haven’t charged anything.
3. Because you probably suck, you need to learn how to suck less.
You suck less by doing more. It’s better to have a few guinea
pigs to get the kinks out. You’ll learn a ton from the people you
help for free, I promise. Even though it may not feel like it now,
you’re getting the better end of the deal.
4. If people get value, especially for free, they’re far more likely
to:
a. Leave positive reviews and testimonials.
b. Give you feedback.
c. Send their friends and family.
And if that’s not awesome enough, free customers can make you
money in three other ways:
1) They convert into paying customers.
2) They send you paying customers via referrals.
3) Their testimonials bring in paying customers.
So no matter what, you win.
What if they say no?
Often, the most expensive part of what you sell isn’t the price–it's
the hidden costs. Hidden costs are the time, effort, and sacrifice it
takes to get results from the thing you sell. In other words, the
bottom part of the value equation. If you struggle to give your stuff
away for free, it means either people don’t want it (dream
outcome), they don’t believe you (perceived likelihood of
achievement) or the hidden costs (time, effort and sacrifice) are too
high. In short, your ‘free’ stuff is too expensive. So figure out the
hidden costs. Once you do, you unlock even more value–that
you’ll eventually be able to charge for.
To build your understanding of hidden costs… ask. So when
someone says “no” ask “why?”:
“What would I have to do to make it worth it for you to continue?”
Their answers give you a chance to solve their problem. And if you
solve that problem, they’ll probably buy from you. And even if
they don’t buy from you, they’ll give you the ammo to get the next
person to.
And remember, failure is a requisite for success. It’s part of the
process. So rack up failures as fast as you can. Get them out of the
way to start paying down your “no tax.” If you get thousands of
nos, you will get your yeses, I promise. I always tell myself: Yeses
give me opportunity. Nos give me feedback. Either way, I win.
(Step 8) “What Do I Do Once I’ve Reached Out To Everyone?”
→ Start Back At The Top
After reaching out to all the leads on one platform, switch to the
platform you have the second most leads on. After you reach out to
those leads, go to the platform you have the third most leads on
and so forth.
Let’s say you follow this to the tee because being poor sucks more
than helping people for free. If between all platforms, you have
1000 leads, that gives you ten solid days of work. A month of work
including follow-ups. By this point, I promise, five or more people
will have accepted your free offer. And some will have converted
into paying customers. If you did a good job, they’ll send friends,
and they’ll become paying customers too.
So, let’s make our first dollar.
(Step 9) “But I can’t work for free forever…” → Start
Charging.
This is important. This is your litmus test to know when you’re
“good enough” to charge. Once people start referring, start
charging. When that happens, swap out ‘… free…’ in the script
above to ‘80% off for the next five’. Then ‘60% off for the next
five.’ Then ‘40% off for the next five,’ and so forth. The “I
increase my prices every five” rule also adds urgency because
prices actually go up. And if you’re curious, you don’t have to stop
raising your price. Feel free to keep raising it by 20% every five
until you find your sweet spot. It’s your business. You can do what
you want. Charge more as you get more experienced - a nice
reward.
(Step 10) “But what do I do from here?” →Keep your list
warm.
Give regular value to your list through email, social media, etc. to
keep it warm. A warm list stays primed for your warm reach outs
in the future. We cover exactly how to give that value in the next
chapter. Once you’ve given value for a while, or see who wants
value, probe your list with Dean Jackson's timeless "9-word email"
template”:
Are you still looking to [4 word desire]?
No images. No frills. No links. Just a question. Nothing else. This
message is money for getting leads to engage. And it’s among the
first things I do when I invest in a new business. Here are a few
examples:
Are you still looking to
…buy your dream home?
…get more sales leads?
…tone up your arms?
…open an online store?
…start a YouTube channel?
You get the idea. Swipe and deploy. You make the ask to see who
replies - aka - engaged leads. And these replies should be your top
priority for warm reach outs.
I’ll end step 10 here because I break down this “give-ask” process
in the next chapter. The main point is that a warm list is a huge
asset because it’s a consistent and growing source of engaged
leads. If you treat them well, your audience will feed you forever.
Advertising Checklist Summary
Now let’s look at this in ten lines because it took ten pages to get
here.
Benchmarks: How well am I doing?
Warm reach outs should get about one in five contacts to engage.
So one hundred warm reach outs should get about twenty replies.
Of the twenty who reply, another one in fiveish will take you up on
your free offer. So, four people. Of the four who take your free
offer now, you should be able to convert one into some sort of paid
offer later. Hooray - money.
This framework allows you to predict how many customers you
get per 100 warm reach outs. In the example, you would get one
customer per 100 reach outs. These numbers vary based on the
value of your offer and how much they trust you. But, no matter
what, with enough volume, you will get a customer. And the more
you do it, the better your numbers will get. It just takes effort.
You’ll also learn a lot about what engages your audience: what
they value and how to make offers to them. This knowledge can
make you millions. You get to learn while you earn - score.
This process alone can take you to $100,000+ per year with
nothing else. Wild, I know. Here’s the money math:
This assumes 1% of your list buys a $400 offer using only warm
reach outs.
500 reach outs per week = 5 customers per week
$400 product → 5 customers per week x $400 each = $2000/wk
$2000/wk x 52 weeks = $104,000…bingo.
Which, as of this writing, is still two times the median household
income in the US. Not bad.
You’ll learn more in the first ten days of doing 100 reach outs than
you did from everything you’ve ever read or watched. Get that
learning done as fast as you can. Remember, we want to get rich,
not just “get by.”
What’s Next?
Warm reach outs have two limitations.
The first is time. When you're starting out, getting new customers
should take the majority of your time. Think four hours per day,
minimum. It should be the first thing you do when you get up. And
you shouldn’t stop until you achieve your goal. Embrace the work.
It will be part of the story you tell one day. It has been for me.
The second limiter is the number of people who know you. You’ll
eventually “run out.” Don’t worry though. We can get more. A lot
more. Now we add the second of the core four advertising
activities: posting free content.

#2 Post Free Content Part I
How To Build An Audience To Get Engaged Leads
No one’s ever complained about getting too much value.
January 2020
“Did you hear about Kylie Jenner?” Leila asked.
“No, why?” I replied.
“She’s now the youngest female self-made billionaire.”
“Wait, what?”
“Yea, she’s twenty. Forbes just put her on the cover.”
I was ten years older than her and not a billionaire. Why do I suck so
much? How could she make so much more than me? I thought I was
pretty good at business–we took home $13M in personal income the
year before. But, I was clearly missing something. And I felt horrible
about it.
My ego protected me… Well, Kris Jenner is her mother and she
must have organized all this. I wrote it off as “rich parents” and
moved on.
A few months later…
Leila looked up from her computer.
“Dude - Huda just sold a minority stake in her company at a $600M
valuation.”
“Huda, the makeup girl?” I replied.
“Yea.”
“Holy cow.” Again? How have I been screwing up so bad? How was
someone so young making so much more money than me?
…She’s in beauty, she can do that, I can’t. I told myself, then carried
on.
A few months later…
A headline caught my eye:
“Conor McGregor’s Proper 12 whiskey hits a $600M valuation
within 12 months of launching.”
Seriously!? - Another person making gobs of money in what felt like
seconds.
A few months later…
I saw another headline. “With an Insane $3.5 Billion Worth, Dwayne
Johnson’s ‘Teremana’ Sweeps the Floor With Conor McGregor’s
‘Proper 12′.”
Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson was now a multi-billionaire. And he
never even talked about business! What am I doing wrong?
A few months later… at a famous friend’s house…
Up to this point, I stayed behind the scenes for the most part. I did
not want to be famous. I wanted to be rich. And I succeeded at that.
But seeing these successes chipped away at my beliefs. Could
building a personal brand be that powerful? Simple answer - yes.
But, I wanted my privacy…
We sat around his kitchen table, and I asked him, “You get all these
weird messages from strangers. People threaten your family. Are you
still happy you became famous?” He replied with something that
changed my life forever:
“If getting weird messages and hate from people I don't know is the
price I have to pay to make the impact I want to have, I’d pay that
price any day of the week.”
I felt exposed. I was being a pansy. I claimed I wanted to make the
impact, but wasn’t willing to pay the price for it. After that
conversation, Leila and I went all in on building personal brands.
***
I have a core belief I’d like to transfer to you. If someone is making
more money than you, they are better at the game of business in
some way. Take it as good news. It means you can learn from them.
Don’t think they had it easy. Don’t think they had a shortcut. Don’t
tell yourself they broke some moral code. Even if it’s true, none of
those beliefs serve you. None of those beliefs make you better.
Years ago, I was vocal about “making content.” I didn’t see the
point. Why would I waste my time making something that would
disappear in a few days? I thought it was a stupid waste of time and
let everyone know. I was wrong. It really wasn’t about the content at
all - it was about the audience. What I didn’t understand was - the
content you create isn’t the compounding asset - the audience is. So
even though the content may disappear in time, your audience keeps
growing.
This was a lesson my ego prevented me from learning for too long. It
took an entire year of getting hit in the face with solid evidence
before I changed my ways. Building an audience is the most
valuable thing I’ve ever done.
I saw Kylie Jenner, Huda Kattan, Connor McGregor, and The Rock
become billionaires “overnight.” My famous friend said a massive
audience was crucial to his success. The overwhelming evidence
broke my beliefs, so I rewrote them. I now saw the power of having
an audience. But, I didn’t know where to start. So, I did what I
always do. I paid for knowledge. Buying somebody else’s experience
saves the time it would take to figure everything out yourself. Leila
bought me four calls with a big influencer who had the type of
audience I wanted to build. She paid $120,000.
On my first call, he told me to post regularly on every platform. So,
that's what I did. Twelve months later, my audience grew by more
than 200,000 people. On my second call, he noted the progress. But I
wanted more, “Do you have a blueprint for your personal branding?
How do you put out all that content?”
He said, “Bro, anyone telling you there’s some secret is trying to sell
you something. We just put out as much as we possibly can. Pull up
your Instagram and pull up my Instagram... Look. You’ve posted
once today. I posted three times. Pull up your LinkedIn… Look. You
posted once this week. I posted five times today.” He went platform
by platform. I grew more embarrassed with each comparison.
“You just gotta do more bro.”
Simple. Not easy. Over the next six months I put out ten times the
content. And over the next six months, I added 1.2M people to my
audience. Also, when I put out ten times the content, my audience
grew ten times as fast. Volume works. Content works. A growing
audience is the result. And in this chapter, I’ll break down how I did
it so you can too.
How Building An Audience Works - You Post Great Free
Content
Warm reach outs don’t get a lot of engaged leads for the time we
invest. If we want to reach ten people, we have to repeat ourselves
ten times. Lots of effort. By posting free content, we can say it once
and reach all ten. So, posting free content can get a lot more engaged
leads for the time we invest. Hooray.
The people who think it’s valuable become part of your warm
audience. If they think other people will find it valuable, they share
it. And if the people they share it with like it, they become part of
your warm audience too. Rinse and repeat. The sharing can go on
infinitely. The more they share your stuff, the larger your warm
audience gets. And once in a while, you’ll make them an offer. If
your offer has enough value, they’ll take it. When they do, you make
money. And the bigger the audience, the more money you make.
Look at it this way:
Posting free content grows your warm audience.
So constantly posting free content means you’ll have a constantly
growing audience of people more likely to buy your stuff.
Free content makes all other advertising more effective. If you
reach out to someone and they can’t find content related to your
services, they’re less likely to buy. On the other hand, if they find
lots of valuable content, they are more likely to buy.
This is what my ego prevented me from learning. Now the headlines
with Jenner, Huda, McGregor, and The Rock all made perfect sense.
But, posting free content is not all sunshine and rainbows. It has
trade-offs. First, it is more difficult to personalize your message. So
fewer people respond. Second, you compete with everyone else
posting free content. This makes it harder to stand out. Third, if you
do stand out, people will copy you. This means you need to
constantly innovate.
That being said - A bigger audience means more engaged leads.
More engaged leads means more money. More money means you
more happy. Just kidding - it won’t do that. But it’ll give you the
resources to remove stuff you hate. Anyways…
This chapter covers only two topics. First, we demystify audiencegrowing
content by showing it’s all made of the same basic units. A
content unit has three components - Hook, retain, and reward.
Second, how linking basic units together will make audiencegrowing
content for any platform or media type. The next chapter
(Post Free Content Part II) shows you how to weaponize this content
to make money. But for now, you can’t monetize content until you
know how to make it.
The Content Unit - Three Components
All audience-growing content does one thing - it rewards the people
consuming it. And a person can only get rewarded by the content if
they:
1) Have a reason to consume it and
2) Pay attention long enough to
3) Get that reason satisfied.
Thankfully, we can reverse those three outcomes into the three
things we have to do to make audience-growing content. This means
we have to:
a) Hook attention: get them to notice your content.
b) Retain attention: get them to consume it.
c) Reward attention: satisfy the reason they consumed it to begin
with.
The smallest amount of material it takes to hook, retain and reward
attention is a content unit. It can be as little as an image, a meme, or
a sentence. Meaning, you can hook, retain, and reward at the same
time. This is how short tweets, meme images, or even a jingle can go
viral. They do all three. I separate them so we can discuss them more
clearly, but they can all happen at once.
Let’s dive into each of the things we do to create a content unit. This
way you can create effective content that grows your audience.
1) Hook: They cannot be rewarded unless we first get their attention.
The objective: We give them a reason to redirect their attention from
whatever they are doing towards us. If we do that, we’ve hooked
them. The effectiveness of your hook is measured by the percentage
of people who start consuming your content. So if you hook
attention well, many people will have a reason to consume your
content. If you do a poor job, few people will have a reason to
consume your content. Remember, this is a competition for attention.
We have to beat every alternative they have to win theirs. Make
yourself the best option.
We increase the percentage of people who pick our content by
picking topics they find interesting, headlines that give them a
reason, and matching the format of other stuff they like. Let’s dive
into each.
Topics. Topics are the things you make your content about. I prefer
to use personal experiences. Here’s why: there’s only one of you.
The easiest way to differentiate is to say something no one else can
say. And no one else has lived your life but you. I divide topics into
five categories: Far Past, Recent Past, Present, Trending, and
Manufactured.
a) Far Past: The important past lessons in your life. Connect that
wisdom to your product or service to provide huge value to your
audience. Give them the story without the scar. It’s why I write
these books.
i) Example: A personal lesson where I broke my belief
that “I don't have enough time”:
1) Hook: I complained to a friend that I didn’t have
enough time to do something while glued to my
phone.
2) Retain: They yanked it out of my hands and looked
at its usage. It showed I spent three hours per day
on social media.
3) Reward: They looked back at me and said, “Hey, I
found you some time.”
It’s a simple story other people can relate to. This
makes it an interesting topic to more people. And it
connects what I do, growing businesses, to a struggle
many people experience - not having enough time.
The epiphany I give away makes this lesson valuable
for my audience – people starting, growing, and selling
their businesses.
b) Recent Past: Do stuff, then talk about what you did (or what
happened). Any time you speak with somebody, there’s a chance
your audience can get value from it. Look at your calendar for the
last week. Look at all your meetings. Look at all your social
interactions. Look at all your conversations with warm reach outs.
There’s gold in these conversations. Tell stories from them that
would serve your audience. For example:
i) This tweet came from a meeting I had with a portfolio
CEO that was just copying the same offer everyone else
in his market was making and was getting subpar results.
ii) This means taking notes, recordings, and other records
to make that stuff easy to access. But it also means a free,
easy, and valuable stash of content.
iii) Testimonials and case studies fall in this category. If you
can tell a cool client story in a way that provides value to
your audience, you’ll both promote your services and
provide value. Win-win.
c) Present: Write down ideas at the exact time they come to you.
Always have a way to record your ideas in arms reach. I’ll even
pause meetings to make note of, text, or email ideas to myself.
People don’t mind when you ask to take notes anyway, so it's not
weird. Then, when you make content, you have a bucket of fresh
stories to work with.
i) I note my ideas publicly: I used to keep ideas to myself.
Now, I tweet them publicly as they happen. If a post does
better than normal, I know it's something people find
interesting. Then, I make more stuff on that topic.
d)Trending: Go where the attention is. Look at what’s trending right
now and make stuff about it. Apply your own experiences to it. If
you have relevant commentary or it touches your expertise in
some way, talk about it. Talking about trendy stuff is very
effective for gaining the attention of a broader audience.
e) Manufactured: Turn your ideas into reality. Pick a topic people
find interesting. Then, learn about it, make it, or do it. Then, show
it to the world. This costs the most time and effort since you have
to create the experience versus talking about one you already had.
But, it can have the biggest payouts.
i) Example manufactured experience: I lived on $100 for a
month. Here’s how. Now I don’t live that way, but I could
manufacture that experience then make content about it.
Action Step: Life happens–profit by sharing yours.
Headlines. A headline is a short phrase or sentence used to grab the
audience’s attention. It communicates the reason they should
consume the content. They use it to weigh the likelihood they will
get a reward for consuming your content versus another.
Rather than give you a bunch of templates, I’d rather give you the
timeless principles that make great headlines. And, there’s no greater
headline creator than “the news.” So let’s study them.
A meta-analysis of news revealed headline components that drove
the most interest in stories. They are as follows. Try and include at
least two in your headline.
a. Recency - As recent as possible, quite literally the ‘new’s
i. Example: People pay attention to something that
happened an hour ago more than a year ago.
b. Relevancy - Personally meaningful
i. Example: Nurses pay more attention to stuff that affects
nurses compared to stuff that affects accountants.
c. Celebrity - Including prominent people (celebrities, authorities,
etc.).
i. Example: Normally, we wouldn’t care what another
human has for breakfast every day. But if it’s Jeff
Bezos, we do. Since he’s a celebrity, many people care.
d. Proximity - Close to home – geographically
i. Example: A house on fire across the country doesn’t get
your attention. If it’s your neighbor, it sure does. Make
it as close to home as possible.
e. Conflict - of opposing ideas, opposing people, nature, etc.
i. Example: Pineapple vs no Pineapple on pizza?
Conflict!
ii. Example: Good vs Evil. Hero vs Villain. Left vs Right.
iii. Example: Freedom vs Security. Justice vs Mercy. You
get the idea.
f. Unusual - odd, unique, rare, bizarre
i. Example: Think of a six-fingered man at the old-time
circuses. If it’s outside of the norm, people pay more
attention.
g. Ongoing - Stories still in progress are dynamic, evolving, and
have plot twists.
i. Example: If someone goes into labor, people want
updates every ten minutes because anything could
happen.
Action Step: Include one or more of these components to give
yourself meatier, attention-grabbing headlines.
Format. Once we have a good topic and communicate it with a
headline using one or more components, we need to match our
format to the best content on the platform. People consume content
because it’s similar to stuff they’ve liked in the past. And matching
the popular format of the platform gets the most people to interact
with it. So, we want to make our content look like the stuff they’ve
liked before.
Format example:
This meme communicates the point better than I can with words. All
four images above are…well…images. But, they have a different
look and feel. This is because formatting depends on the audience
you want to hook and the platform your audience is on.
Bottom Line: You’ve gotta make your content look like what they
expect will reward them. Otherwise, no matter how good it is, betterlooking
content will hook them before yours even has a chance.
Action Step: Format your content for the platform first. Then, tweak
it so it hooks your ideal audience. Use the best content on the
platform that targets your market as your guide.
This concludes the “hook” step of our content unit. Always following
these basics will already put you in the top 1%. At least, it has for
me.
2) Retain
My favorite driver of retention is curiosity. It’s my favorite because,
if done correctly, people will wait years. People want to know what
happens…next. For example, I get messages daily, for years now,
about when I will release a book on sales.
My favorite way to get the audience curious is to embed questions in
their minds. Unresolved questions can be explicit or implicit. You
can directly ask the question. Or, the question can be implied. My
three favorite ways to embed questions are: lists, steps, and stories.
a) Lists: Lists are things, facts, tips, opinions, ideas, etc. presented
one after the other. Good lists in free content also follow a theme.
Think “Top 10 Mistakes” or “5 Biggest Money Makers” and so
on. Giving the number of listed items in your headline, or in the
first few seconds of your content, tells people what to expect. And
in my experience, this retains more of the audience's attention for
longer.
i) Example: “7 Ways I invested $1000 in my 20s That
Paid Off Big”
ii) Example: “28 Ways To Stay Poor”
iii) Example: “A content unit has three pieces…”,
b) Steps: Steps are actions that occur in order and accomplish a goal
when completed. Provided the early steps were clear and valuable,
the person will want to know how to do them all to accomplish the
overall goal.
i) Example: “3 Steps to Creating a Great Hook”
ii) Example: “How I Create a Headline in 7 Steps”
iii) Example: “The Morning Routine That Boosts My
Productivity”
Note: Here’s the difference between steps and lists. Steps are actions
that must be done in a specific order to get a result. So steps are less
flexible but have a more explicit reward. Lists can have just about
anything on them in any order you want. So lists are more flexible
but have a less explicit reward.
c) Stories: Stories describe events, real or imaginary. And stories
worth telling often have some lesson or takeaway for the listener.
You can tell stories about things that have happened, might
happen, or will never happen. All three drive curiosity because
people want to know what happens next.
i) Ex: Almost every chapter in this book has a story.
ii) Ex: “My editor made me do 19 drafts of this book -
here’s what I did to him.”
iii) Ex: “My journey from sleeping on the bottom floor of a
gym to the top floor of a 5-star hotel.”
You can use lists, steps, and stories on their own or interweave them.
For example, you can have lists within steps, and a story about each
list item. You can have stories to reinforce the value of a step. You
can have a list of stories or many ongoing storylines. Etc. Your
creativity is the only limit here. That’s why people who make a lot of
content call themselves content creators. This chapter, for example,
has lists within steps and stories interweaving them.
Action Step: Use lists, steps, and stories to keep your audience
curious. Embed questions in their minds to make them want to know
what happens next.
3) Reward
Anyone can think of cool hooks and organize their content using
lists, steps, or stories. But the real question is - is it good? Does it
satisfy the reason they watched to begin with? Does it make people
want to share it? How good your content is depends on how often it
rewards your audience in the time it takes them to consume it. Think
value per second. For example, the same person who gets bored
three seconds into a ten-second video may also binge a 900-page
book. And that same person may binge a television series for eight
hours straight. So there is no such thing as too long, only too boring.
Now, we can’t guarantee a specific reward. But, we can increase the
chance reward happens by:
Hooking the right audience with proper topics, headlines, and
formatting
Retaining them with lists, steps, and stories to get them curious
and wanting more
Clearly satisfying the reason the content hooked them to begin
with.
Example: If your hook promises “7 Ways to Make Up with Your
Spouse” and you give:
(A) four ways (B) seven ways that stunk (or they’ve heard them all
before). (C) you’re talking to a room of single guys who don’t have
spouses, you did a bad job of rewarding. People will not want to
watch again, and certainly won’t share it.
Example: If your hook promises “4 Marketing Strategies Dentists
Can Use” and they can’t use them, they will not share it or watch
your content in the future. You did a bad job of rewarding.
Bottom line: I’ve had tons of content I thought would smash records
but the audience smashed the next button instead. So no matter how
good you think your content is, the audience decides. Rewarding
your audience means matching or exceeding their expectations when
they decide to consume your content. Here’s how you know if you
succeeded: your audience grows. If it’s not growing, your stuff isn’t
that good. Practice and you’ll get better.
Action Step: Provide more value than anyone else. Make good on
your promises. Clearly satisfy the hook you used to get their
attention. In other words, completely answer the unresolved
questions you embedded in their minds.
So what’s the difference between short and long form content?
Answer: not much.
If you recall from earlier, the smallest amount of material it takes to
hook, retain and reward attention is a content unit. So to create a
longer piece of content, we simply link content units together.
For example, a single step in a five-step list might be a content unit.
When we link all five together, we have a longer piece of content.
Here’s a visual to drive it home.
Shorter content hooks, retains, rewards fewer times. Longer content
does it more times. And doing it more times takes more skill because
you have to string more “good” content units in a row. For example,
a new comedian typically will only get a few minutes on stage to
perform their “bit.” Only a master comic gets an hour. It takes
practice to reward attention just often enough to keep it for that long.
So, start small, then build from there. Even if you start with longer
content, which is fine, I suggest starting with shorter versions. You’ll
have an easier go of it. Many successful authors with epic-length
novels started by writing…you guessed it…short stories.
Once you understand how to make a content unit, all you have to do
is more. Then, your audience will grow. And once your audience
grows big enough, you may want to monetize it. I had too much to
say to fit into one chapter, so we’ll talk about how to monetize the
audience in the next one.
See you there.
#2 Post Free Content Part II
Monetize Your Audience
“Give-give-give, give-give-give, until they ask”
The point of this chapter is to show you how to monetize your
warm audience. First, we talk about how we can make offers and
not be a spam monster - mastering the give : ask ratio. Then we’ll
talk about the two offer strategies to monetize the audience. After
that, I’ll talk about how to scale your output so you can grow a
bigger audience faster and make even more money. Then, I’ll share
a bunch of lessons I’ve learned in building my own audience that I
wish I had known sooner. Finally, I’ll wrap this up with how you
can take action on everything today.
Mastering the Give : Ask ratio
Gary Vaynerchuk popularized “jab, jab, jab, right hook.” It
simplifies the idea of giving to your audience many times before
making an ask. You deposit goodwill with rewarding content, then
withdraw from it by making offers. When you deposit goodwill,
your audience pays more attention. When you deposit goodwill,
your audience is more likely to do what you ask. So I try to “underask”
my audience and build as much goodwill as possible.
Thankfully, the give : ask ratio has been well-studied. Television
averages 13 minutes of advertising per 60 minutes of air time. That
means 47 min are dedicated to ‘giving,’ and 13 min are dedicated
to ‘asking’. That’s roughly a 3.5:1 ratio of giving to asking. On
Facebook, it’s roughly 4 content posts for every 1 ad on the
newsfeed. This gives us an idea of the minimum give : ask ratio we
can sustain. After all, television and Facebook are mature
platforms. They care less about growing their audiences and care
more about making money from them. So they give less and ask
more. Which means “give, give, give, ask” is the ratio that gets us
closer to maximally monetizing an audience without shrinking it.
But, most of us want to grow, so we shouldn’t model them. We
should model growing platforms.
So what do growing platforms do? They display lots of content
without many advertisements at all. In short, they give give give…
give give give…give give give…give give give…maybe ask. They
dramatically over give and under ask. Why? Because the more you
reward your audience, the bigger it gets. So if you want to grow an
audience, give far far more than you ask.
And now that I have some experience with it, I’ve got a slight
tweak on the traditional give-ask strategy that puts it on steroids:
Give until they ask.
People are always waiting for you to ask for money. And when you
don’t, they trust you more. They share your stuff more. You grow
faster, etc. But I’m not some altruistic saint. I’m here to make
money. After all, I wouldn’t be a good businessman if I weren’t
making any.
So, it’s simple. If you give enough, people start asking you. It
makes people uncomfortable to continue to receive without giving
back. It is core to our culture and DNA. They’ll go to your website,
DM you, email you, etc., to ask for more. Not only that, when you
use this strategy, you get the best customers. They are the ones
who are the biggest ‘givers.’ They are the ones who, even as
paying customers, still feel they get the better end of the deal. And
best of all, if you advertise this way, your growth never slows.
When you use this strategy, you give in public, ask in private. You
let the audience self-select when they’re ready to give you money.
That’s why, in my opinion, give until they ask is the best strategy.
But, if you feel like asking, I get it. So, let’s talk about how to ask.
If you’re gonna do it, you might as well do it well.
Bottom Line: The moment you start asking for money is the
moment you decide to slow down your growth. So the more patient
you are, the more you will get when you finally make your ask.
Action Step: Give give give give give give until they ask
How To Make Money From Content: Ask
To be clear, I think you should use the give until they ask strategy.
But, if you need to pay rent, feed your family, etc., I get it.
Sometimes you gotta ask. So let’s talk about how to do that
without sounding like a nincompoop.
Think of ‘asks’ as commercials. You interrupt this program with a
very important message. Since you are the one providing the value,
you interrupt your own content with commercials about the stuff
you sell. But, since it’s your audience, you pay the cost of potential
loss of trust, slowing growth, and of course, the time it took you to
gather the audience in the first place. But money-wise, it’s free.
Now, I use two strategies to weave promotions into content:
integrated offers and intermittent offers. Let’s cover both.
Integrated: You can advertise in every piece of content so long as
you keep your give : ask ratio high. You will continue to grow your
warm audience and get engaged leads. Win-win.
For example, if I make an hour-long podcast, having 3 x 30-second
ads means I’d have 58.5 min of giving to 1.5 min of asking. Well
above the 3:1 ratio.
On the flip side, I had a friend who had a podcast that blew up
quickly. Eager to monetize his new audience, he started making
offers (asking) too frequently -in- the content. His podcast not only
stopped growing, it actually shrank! Don’t be like that. Don’t kill
your golden goose. It’s a balancing act. Over-give to protect your
most valuable asset - the goodwill of your audience.
Action step: I most commonly integrate the ‘asks’ - aka - CTAs
after a valuable moment or the end of the content piece. Consider
trying one of those places first - and make sure your audience
growth doesn’t slow. Then add in the second and so forth.
Intermittent: The second way you can monetize is through
intermittent asks. Here’s how it works. You make many pieces of
content of pure ‘gives’ then occasionally make an ‘ask’ piece.
Example: You make 10 ‘give’ posts, and on the 11th, you promote
your stuff.
The difference between the first way and the second way depends
on the platform. On short platforms, the intermittent way will
dominate. On long-form platforms, integrations are often your best
bet.
When you make your ask, you either advertise your core offer, or
you advertise your lead magnet. That’s it. Don’t overcomplicate
this.
Lead Magnet Example: If I just talked about a way to get more
leads on a post/video/podcast/etc., I would then say, “I have 11
more tips that have helped me do this. Go to my site to grab a
pretty visual of them.” And as long as I have an audience that
wants to get more leads, this will get some of them to engage.
Then, the thank you page after the opt-in page for my lead magnet
would display my paid offer with some video explaining how it
works. Bonus points if your lead magnet is relevant to your content
advertising it.
Offer Example: You can also ‘go for the jugular’ with your core
offer and go straight for the sale. The direct path to money. We
model our offer from the last chapter.
“I’m looking for 5 (specific avatar) to help achieve (dream
outcome) in (time delay). The best part is, you don’t have to (effort
and sacrifice). And if you don’t get (dream outcome), I will do two
things (increase perceived likelihood of achievement): 1) I will
hand you your money back 2) I will work with you until you do. I
do this because I want everyone to have an amazing experience
with us and because I’m confident I can deliver on my promise. If
that sounds fair, DM me/book a call/comment below/reply to this
email/ etc.”
After you make your ask, get back to providing value.
*^This box is an example of an integration.
Action Step One: Pick whether you integrate it or make an
intermittent ask. Then, pick whether you’ll advertise your core
offer or lead magnet. If you’re not sure, do the lead magnet. It’s
lower risk.
How to Scale It
After you start asking, you’re gonna start getting leads and making
money. But you don't want to stop there, do you? Didn’t think so.
Cool, so let’s talk about scale.
There are two opposing strategies to scale your warm audience.
They both follow progressive steps. First, you have the depth-thenwidth
approach. Then, you have the width-then-depth approach.
Both are right. Here’s how they work:
Depth then width: Maximize a platform, then move onto the next
platform.
Step #1: Post content on a relevant platform.
Step #2: Post content regularly on that platform.
Step #3: Maximize quality and quantity of the content on that
platform. Short form, you may sometimes be able to get up
to ten times per day per platform. Long form, you may have
to get up to five days per week (see soap operas).
Step #4: Add another platform while maintaining the quality and
quantity on the first platform.
Step #5: Repeat steps 1-4 until all relevant platforms are maximized.
Advantages: Once you figure out one platform, you maximize
your return on that effort. Audiences compound faster the more
you do. You take advantage of this compounding. Fewer resources
are required to make this work.
Disadvantages: You have less low hanging fruit of new platforms
and new audiences. You don’t accomplish the feeling of
‘omnipresence.’ In the beginning, you risk your business being
reliant on a single channel. This is a risk because platforms change
all the time and sometimes ban you for no reason. If you only have
one way to get customers, it can kill your business if it gets shut
down.
Width then depth: Get on every platform early, then maximize
them together.
Step #1: Post content on a relevant platform.
Step #2: Post content regularly on that platform.
Step #3: Here’s where this strategy differs from the one before.
Instead of maximizing your first platform. Move onto the
next relevant platform while maintaining the previous.
Step #4: Continue until you are on all relevant platforms.
Step #5: Now, maximize your content creation on all platforms at
once.
Advantages: You reach a broader audience faster. And, you can
“repurpose” your content. So with a little extra work, you can
capture tons of efficiency. With minimal changes to the format,
you can make the same content fit multiple platforms. For
example, it takes little extra effort to format a single short video
across all platforms distributing short video content.
Disadvantages: It costs more labor, attention, and time, to do this
well. Oftentimes, people end up with lots of bad content
everywhere. Sucky fluff. No bueno.
If you already have a sizable business, scale up faster and reap the
rewards of an asset that only gets better with time. I said it before
and I’ll say it again. The best day to start posting content was the
day you were born. The second best day is today. Don’t wait like I
did.
Action Step: Pick an approach. Start posting. Then, go up the
scaling steps over time.
Why You Should Make Content (even if it’s not your primary
advertising strategy)
January 2020.
I called all the major departments to a meeting to answer an
important question: Why isn’t our paid advertising working like it
used to? Opinions flooded the room. “The creative…the copy…the
offer…our pages…our sales process…our price…” They shot back
and forth at each other, every bit as invested as I was in solving the
problem.
Leila and I sat quietly as the team debated. After the din died
down, Leila, in her wise fashion, asked a different question: What
did we stop doing in the months before the decline?
A new debate arose and a unanimous answer surfaced: Alex
stopped making gym content and started talking about general
business. Now, I didn’t know how important that was, but I had to
find out. So, I sent a survey to our gym owners. I asked if they had
consumed any content of mine before they booked a call. The
results astounded me.
78% of all clients had consumed at least TWO long form pieces of
content, prior to booking a call.
I had fallen into my old ways and given paid ads all the credit. But,
our free content was nurturing the demand. Don’t make the same
mistake I did. Your free content gives strangers an opportunity to
find, get value from, and share your stuff. And, it warms people on
the fence that go to and come from the cold audience methods we
dive into next. So even if it’s hard to measure, free content gets
you better returns on all advertising methods.
Bottom line: Start making content relevant to your audience. It
will make you more money.
7 Lessons I’ve Learned From Making Content
1) Switch from “How to” to “How I.” From “This is the best way”
to “These are my favorite ways” etc. (especially when starting
out). Talk about what you’ve done, not what others should do.
What you like, not this is the best. When you talk about experience,
no one can question you. This makes you bulletproof.

oatmeal this way.

Figure Agency.
c) My favorite way to generate leads for my business vs. This is
the best way to generate leads for your business.
It’s subtle. But when you tell your experience, you are sharing
value. When you tell a stranger what to do, it's hard to avoid
coming off preachy or arrogant. This helps avoid it.
2) We Need To Be Reminded More Than We Need To Be Taught:
You’re a silly goose if you think 100 percent of your audience
listens 100 percent of the time. For example, I post about my book
every single day. I surveyed my audience and asked them if they
knew I had a book. One in five that saw the post said they didn’t
know. Keep repeating yourself. You’ll get bored of your content
before your whole audience even sees it.
3) Puddles, Ponds, Lakes, Oceans. Narrow the focus of your content.
If you have a small local business, you probably shouldn’t make
general business content. Not at first, at least. Why? The audience
will listen to people with better track records than you. But you can
narrow your topics to what you do and the place you do it.
Example: plumbing in a certain town. If you do that, you can
become king of that puddle. Over time, you can expand your
plumbing puddle to the general local business pond. Then the lake
of brick & mortar chains and so forth. Then eventually, the ocean
of general business.
4) Content Creates Tools For Salespeople. Some content will
perform well and get more people interested in buying your stuff.
That content helps your sales team. Create a master list of your
“greatest hits.” Label each ‘hit’ with the problem it solves and the
benefit it provides. Then, your sales team can send it before or after
sales calls and help people decide to buy. They work especially
well if the content resolves specific concerns prospects commonly
face.
5) Free Content Retains Paying Customers. How a customer gets
value from you matters less than where they got it. Imagine a
person pays for your thing and then consumes your free content. If
your free content is valuable, they will like you more and stay loyal
to your business longer. On the flip side, if they consume your free
content, and it sucks, they will like your paid product less. Here’s
something you may not know. Somebody who buys your stuff is
more likely to consume your free content. This is why it’s so
important to make your free content good - your customers will
include it in how they calculate their ROI from your paid thing.
6) People don't have shorter attention spans, they have higher
standards. Repeated for emphasis: there’s no such thing as too
long, only too boring. Streaming platforms have proven that people
will spend hours binging long form content if they like it. Our
biology hasn't changed, our circumstances have. They have more
rewarding stuff to choose from. So make good stuff people like and
reap the rewards rather than whining about people’s “short
attention spans.”
7) Avoid Pre-Scheduling Posts. The posts I manually post perform
better than ones I pre-schedule. Here’s my theory. When you
manually post, you know that within seconds you will be rewarded
or punished for the quality of the content. Because of that close
feedback loop, you try *that much harder* to make it better. When
I schedule stuff out, I don’t feel that same pressure. So whenever I
post, or my team does, we strongly believe in someone pressing the
‘submit’ button because it gives that last bit of pressure to get it
right. Try it.
Benchmarks - How Well Am I Doing?
If our audience grows, we did good. But if our audience grows
fast, we did gooder. So I like to measure my audience size and
speed of growth monthly.
Here’s what I measure:
1) Total followers and reach - How big
a) Follower Example: If I go from 1000 followers across
all platforms to 1500, I grew my audience by 500.
b) Reach Example: If I go from 10,000 people seeing my
stuff to 15,000 people seeing my stuff, I grew my reach
by 5,000 people.
2) Rate of getting followers and reach - How fast
You compare the growth between months:
a) Example: If I gained those 500 followers in a month,
that would make it a 50% growth month. (500 New /
1000 Started = 50% growth rate).
b) Example: If I reached those 5000 extra people in a
month, that would make it a 50% growth month. (5000
New / 10,000 Started = 50% growth rate)
Remember, we can only control inputs. Measuring outputs is only
useful if we are consistent with inputs. So, pick the posting
cadence you want to stick with on a particular platform. Then pick
your ‘ask’ cadence on that platform (how you will direct people to
become engaged leads). Then, start, and…Do. Not. Stop.
For reference, I posted a new podcast twice a week for four years
before even getting picked up on the Top 100 list. Because I did
the same thing every week for years, I knew I could trust the
feedback. In the beginning, it didn't grow much. It took time for
me to get better. And I knew I had to make more, over a long time,
for that to happen.
So if your listeners go from ten to fifteen in a month, that’s
progress baby! Even with small absolute numbers, that’s fifty
percent monthly growth! It’s why I like to measure both the
absolute and relative growth and pick the one that makes me feel
better (ha!). As my friend Dr. Kashey says, “The more ways you
measure, the more ways you can win.” Be consistent. Measure a
lot. Adapt to feedback. Be a winner.
To close the loop, in its fifth year, my podcast- The Game, became
a Top 10 podcast in the US for business and top 500 in the world.
This was only possible after 5 years of multiple podcasts per week
every week. Remember, everyone starts at zero. You just gotta give
time, time.
Your First Post
You’ve probably been providing value to other humans knowingly
or unknowingly for a while. So the first post you make, you can
make an ask. My hope is that it gets you your first engaged lead. If
it doesn’t, you need to give for a while, then make an ask once
you’ve earned the right to. To show you that I’m not making this
up, below you can find my first business post ever. Is it ideal? No.
I had no idea what I was doing. Should you copy it, probably not.
Main point: don’t be afraid of what other people think. If someone
won’t speak at your funeral, you shouldn’t care about their opinion
while you’re alive. Honor the few who believe in you by having
courage.
Whenever I read this, I just think “you goon.” But hey, I was
trying. And for that, I’m proud.

Now, you know. Nothing’s stopping you.
So What Do I Do Right Now?
Posting free content is less predictable than, but complementary to,
warm reach outs. So keep doing warm reach outs. Also, posting
free content grows your warm audience. And a bigger warm
audience means more people for warm reach outs. So free content
gets engaged leads on its own and keeps getting engaged leads
through warm reach outs. Instead of ditching one for the other, I
recommend you post free content in addition to warm reach outs.
Let’s fill out our daily action commitment for our first platform.
Next Up
First, we start with warm outreach. We reach out to every person
we have permission to contact. Second, we post publicly about the
successes and lessons we have from our first clients. We post
testimonials. We provide value. Then occasionally ask. We commit
to doing both of these activities every day.
With these two methods alone can eventually build a six- or sevenfigure
business. But you may want to go faster. So we venture from
warm audiences who know us, to cold audiences who don’t. We
begin reaching out to strangers. This begins the third step in our
advertising journey: cold outreach.

Free Goodwill
“He who said money can’t buy happiness hasn’t given enough
away.” – Unknown
People who give without expectation live longer, happier lives and
make more money. So if we’ve got a shot at that during our time
together, darn it, I’m gonna try.
To do that, I have a question for you…
Would you help someone you’ve never met if it cost you nothing,
but you didn’t get credit?
Who is this person you ask? They are like you. Or, at least, like
you used to be. Less experienced, wanting to make a difference,
and needing help, but not sure where to look.
Acquisition.com’s mission is to make business accessible to
everyone. Everything we do stems from that mission. And, the
only way for us to accomplish that mission is by reaching…well…
everyone.
This is where you come in. Most people do, in fact, judge a book
by its cover (and its reviews). So here’s my ask on behalf of a
struggling entrepreneur you’ve never met:
Please help that entrepreneur by leaving this book a review.
Your gift costs no money and less than 60 seconds to make real,
but can change a fellow entrepreneur’s life forever. Your review
could help…
….one more small businesses provide for their community.
….one more entrepreneur support their family.
….one more employee get meaningful work.
…one more client transform their life.
…one more dream come true.
To get that ‘feel good’ feeling and help this person for real, all
you have to do is….and it takes less than 60 seconds…leave a
review.
If you are on audible - hit the three dots in the top right of your
device, click rate & review, then leave a few sentences about the
book with a star rating.
If you are reading on kindle or an e-reader - scroll to the bottom of
the book, then swipe up and it will prompt a review for you.
If for some reason these changed- you can go to Amazon (or
wherever you purchased this) and leave a review right on the
book’s page.

#3 Cold Outreach
How To Reach Out To Strangers To Get Engaged Leads
“Quantity has a quality all of its own” - Napoleon Bonaparte
July 2020.
COVID-19 raged. In a matter of months, thirty percent of my
customers went out of business. Protestors filled every platform
with hate and anger. Politicians made promises. Small businesses
suffered in silence. Unemployment skyrocketed. The most
tumultuous election ever was upon us. And here we were, trying to
generate leads to pay our bills. Employees everywhere, and their
families, depended on it.
All three of my companies at the time (Gym Launch, Prestige
Labs, and ALAN) relied on brick-and-mortar businesses staying
open. And, they were closed. Brilliant strategy Alex. To make
matters worse, Apple did a software update that crippled our ads.
The market was crap. Our paid ads were crap. And I carried the
bucket.
I ran through worst-case scenarios. How much cash would it take
to keep us afloat? How long do I keep paying people when there’s
no end in sight? Should I dip into personal accounts? Give up a
third of my life savings? Half? All of it? What does that say about
me? I had no idea what to do.
Early that Saturday morning…
I tried to sleep long enough for my alarm to wake me, but it was no
use. I went to my office and checked Instagram. I had a new
message waiting for me:
“Hey Alex - Cale told me you guys don’t need salesmen anymore,
so my offer got pulled. I quit my job to accept it. Super honored
you considered me. I hope you’ll consider me again the next time
you have openings.”
Looking for context, I scrolled up. Reading our earlier messages
rewarded me with a pang of guilt. I was the one who told him to
apply. He took the rejection well. A sign of a good salesman. I felt
obligated to reply.
“You on?” I messaged.
“Yes,” he replied.
“Got 5?”
“Yes”
We hopped on a call. He sounded a little nervous, but I could tell
he knew his stuff. It sucks we don’t have enough leads for this
guy…
“I’ve wanted to work for you a while now. I read your book and
used the scripts to become the top producer at my company,” he
said.
“That’s awesome. I’m so glad to hear it. What kind of company?” I
asked.
“A gym software company.”
I hadn’t heard of them. “Oh interesting. How do you guys get
leads?”
“We’re 100% cold outreach.”
“You cold call and cold email gyms, then sell them software?”
“Yea, pretty much.”
“How big is the team?”
“We’ve got about thirty guys.”
A team of 30!? “What’s your revenue like if you can share that
with me.”
“We’re doing about $10,000,000 per month now.”
Insane. “Just from cold outreach?”
“Yea, we run some ads, but we haven’t cracked that yet.”
“And you do this with a retention offer? You’re not even really
making gyms more money?”
“Yea, it's definitely not as easy to sell as the stuff you do for
gyms.”
“Do you think you could use the same cold outreach system here?”
“I’ve never started a team, but I bet I could figure it out.”
“Alright. What was the offer Cale pulled?”
“I was gonna be a closer, but he said you guys didn't need one
anymore.”
I thought for a moment. “Well, given our current lead volume, he’s
probably right. But, if you can get your own leads, I’ll give you the
runway to get cold outreach going. What do you think?”
“It takes a while to get going. I’ll have to figure out the scripts for
your offer.”
“Yeah, that makes sense. How long, you think?”
“I’m confident I could make it profitable in twelve weeks.”
“Alright, deal. I’ll let Cale know the plan. To be clear, you’ll be
expected to figure all this out. The software. The lists. Everything.
I’ll front you the time, but we can’t support you much beyond
that.”
“Understood.”
Here’s what happened during the months that followed:
September: 0 Sales. Zippola. Nothin’. Zilch. Nada.
October: 2 Sales ($32,000 in revenue) Team asks me to pull the
plug on cold outreach.
December: 4 Sales ($64,000 in revenue) Team asks me to pull the
plug, again.
January: 6 Sales ($96,000 in revenue)
February: 10 Sales ($160,000 in revenue)
March: 14 Sales ($224,000 in revenue)
April: 20 Sales ($320,000 in revenue)
May: 30 Sales ($480,000 in revenue)
Today: Cold outreach generates millions per month for our
businesses
Making this work took every (legal) cold outreach method we
knew. Cold calls….Cold emails….Cold Direct
Messages….Voicemails. Everything. But, piece by piece, we built
a reliable customer-getting machine. I wanted something that
would endure.
And that’s what I’m gonna show you how to build.
I learned five important lessons from this experience:
1) There was another company in my space making a lot more
money than mine. It broke my belief about how big the market
really was.
2) They made all their money through private advertising. I had no
way of knowing they existed unless they contacted me first. So,
they kind of operated in secret.
3) They built a very profitable cold outreach machine in my space.
If they could do it, so could I.
4) It’s good to have proper expectations. Cold outreach veterans
told me it would take a year to scale. I figured we could do it in
twelve weeks. I was wrong. It took almost a year. Cold outreach
takes a long time. At least, it did for me.
5) We tried cold outreach two times before and failed. Working
with a person that had done it all before was immensely helpful in
getting this going. I hope to be that person for you now.
How Cold Outreach Works
At some point, you’ll want one of two things. Either, you’ll want to
grow faster than you currently are. Or, you’ll want to increase the
predictability of your lead flow…
Here’s how we can do that. We advertise to people who don’t
know us. Cold audiences. And like before, we can contact them
publicly or privately. In this chapter, we focus on private one-toone
communication with cold outreach. For added context, cold
outreach sits atop the foundation of warm outreach. So think of this
as the more advanced cousin of warm outreach, no longer limited
by your warm audience.
If you can figure out a way to contact somebody one-to-one, you
can use it for cold outreach. You knock on 100 doors. You make
100 phone calls. You send 100 direct messages. You send 100
voicemails. All these are examples of cold outreach that have made
companies zillions. It worked 100 years ago. It works today. And
when the platforms change, it’ll work tomorrow.
Cold outreach has one key difference from warm outreach: trust.
Strangers don’t trust you.
And compared to people who know us, strangers present three new
problems.
1) First, you don't have a way to contact them. Duh.
2) Second, even if you can contact them, they ignore you.
3) Third, even if they give you their attention, they’re not
interested.
Let me describe what these problems look like in the real world.
If you’re knocking on doors, you don't have the addresses. Then,
even if you do, they don't open the door when you knock. If they
open, they still tell you to pound sand.
If you’re making cold calls, you don't have their phone numbers.
Even if you do, they don't pick up. If they pick up, they hang up on
you.
If you're sending cold emails, you don’t have their email addresses.
Even if you do, they don’t open the email. Even if they do, they
don’t respond.
If you’re sending direct messages, you don’t have a place to send
it. Even if you do, they don’t read it. Even if they read it, they
don’t reply.
If you’re sending voice memos or text messages, you don’t have
their numbers. Even if you do, they don’t read or listen to it. Even
if they read or listen to it, they don’t reply.
Now that we got that out of the way, the order we solve these
problems is:
1) Get a way to contact them
2) Figure out what to say
3) Contact them until they’re ready and able to listen
The Result. We find lots of ways to contact the most qualified
strangers. We reach out to a lot of them in a lot of ways a lot of
times. Then, we overwhelm them with value upfront to get them to
show enough interest to move forward.
Cold outreach is a numbers game. The more people you reach out
to the more engaged leads you get. Once we figure out how much
outreach it takes to engage a lead, then we only have one thing to
do…more. Let’s go hunting!
As there are three new problems strangers introduce, I’ve divided
this chapter into three steps. One step per problem. First, we get a
targeted list of leads. Next, we need to know what to say to get
them to reply. Third, we make up for a lower response rate by
increasing the volume and type of our reach out attempts.
Problem #1: “But how do I contact them?” →Build a List
Up until this point, from warm reach outs and posting free content,
you’ve had to accept the leads that came to you from your warm
audience. No more. With cold outreach, unlike any other way of
advertising, we get to be as specific as we want. Only want to talk
to hedge fund managers managing over $1B? Done. You can do
that. Only want to speak with golf apparel retail store owners over
$3M in sales? Done. Only want to talk to influencers who get over
50,000 unique page views per month? Done. Now we get to pick
our targets rather than them picking us.
Now, you probably don’t have a way to reach out to 1000 perfect
fit strangers. And if we’re gonna get them to buy from us, we’ve
gotta first find a way to contact them–duh. So let’s solve that
problem first.
There are three different ways I get my targeted lead lists. First, I
use software to scrape a list of names. Second, I pay brokers to
assemble me a list of targeted leads. And if neither of those work, I
manually scrape a list of names myself. Here’s the process.
Step #1 Softwares: I subscribe to as many softwares as I can that
scrape leads from different sources. I search them all based on
my criteria. The software then spits out names, job titles, contact
information, etc. I try out a representative sample, say a few
hundred from each software I use. Then, if the contact
information is up to date, the leads are responsive, and they are
the type of person the software claims them to be, bingo! Then I
get as many leads as the software will give me. But if I can’t
seem to find the right audience, I move onto step two.
Step #2 Brokers: I go to multiple list brokers and ask them to
make me a list based on my audience criteria. They then send
me a sample. I test out sample lists from each of the brokers. If I
get good results from one or more brokers, I stick with their
lists. And if I still can’t find who I’m looking for, I move to step
three.
Step #3 Elbow Grease: I join groups and communities that I
think have my audience. When I find people that meet my
qualifications, I check to see if they have ways to contact them
in the group’s directory–like links to their social media profiles,
etc. If they do, I add them to my list. If they don’t, I can reach
out to them within the platform hosting the group. I prefer to
find contact information outside the group so I don’t come off as
someone solely trying to milk the group for business but I will if
I have to.
So I work my way from the most accessible leads to the least
accessible leads. Here’s an important point. If you can search the
database, so can everyone else. But if you assemble a list of names
yourself, it’s less likely that person has already received many cold
reach outs from other companies. So they’re the freshest.
Downside: it takes the most time. Of course, you can pay someone
else to do this for you once you figure it out for yourself, but we’re
only talking about getting started in this chapter. We’ll talk about
scaling in Section IV.
Action Step: Find your scraping tool by searching “outbound
leads scraping tool” or “database lead scraping.” Find brokers the
same way. With a few clicks, you’ll find what you’re looking for.
Put your first 1000 names together. If you have more time than
money, you might want to start at step three since it only costs
time.
Problem #2: “I have my list, but what do I say to them?”
→Personalize, Then Give Big Fast Value
Now that you have your list of leads, you gotta figure out what to
say. I went over a lot of scripting in the Warm Reach Outs section–
this section builds on that one. At the end of this chapter, I also
include three sample scripts you can model for cold calls, cold
emails, and cold chat messaging. That being said, there are two
important factors I emphasize to get strangers to engage:
personalization and big fast value. This is important because they
don't know us and they don’t trust us. We’ve gotta overcome both
issues in a matter of seconds.
a) They Don’t Know Us→Personalize (Act Like You Know Them).
To get more leads to engage, we want the message to look like it’s
from someone they know. The best way to do that is to actually know
something about the person you are contacting. In essence, we want
our cold reach out to look like a warm reach out.
…Imagine your phone rings from an unknown number and area code.
Are you likely to pick it up? Probably not. What about if the number
is from your area code? A little more likely. Why is that? Because it
might be someone you know. So to take this concept further, imagine
you pick up the phone...
…The person says “<Your name?>” then pausing (like a normal
person). You’d say, “yea…who’s this?” Now, if that person then went
on to say, “it’s Alex…then pauses…I watched a few of your videos
and read that recent blog post you wrote on dog training. It was killer!
Really helped me out with my doberman. She’s a beast! That peanut
butter trick really helped. Thanks for that.”
You’d still be wondering what’s going on. But you know what you
wouldn’t be doing?…hanging up. Then you hear, “Oh yea, sorry, I got
ahead of myself. I work for a company that helps dog trainers fill up
their books. We like to partner with the best in the area. So I’m always
on the lookout. We worked with someone about an hour north from
you…John’s Doggy Daycare…heard of them?”
You’d respond yes or no (it doesn’t matter), and they’d say, “Yea, we
ended up getting them 100 appointments in 30 days using a
combination of text email and some ads. Do you offer similar services
to them?” To which you’d probably say yes. Then they’d say, “Oh
that’s perfect. Then we’d be able to use that same campaign in your
market and drive leads over to you. If you got a boatload of high
paying new dog training customers you wouldn’t be upset with me
would you?” You’d laugh lightly. “Okay great. Well…tell ya what…I
can walk you through the entire thing soup to nuts later today. Will
you be around at 4?” And you’d say - sure - or whatever. The point is,
if that person had started the call with “hey man, wanna buy some
marketing services?” you’d probably have hung up.
Personalization is what gets your foot in the door to get the sale.
Basically one to three pieces of information we can find that a friend
might know about the prospect. Then we want to complement them on
it, and ideally, show them how it benefited us. People like people who
like them. Even if someone doesn’t know you, they’ll give you more
time if you know something about them.
This comes in handy for personal subject lines on emails, the first few
messages in chat, or the first few sentences someone hears. Even if
someone doesn’t know you, they will appreciate the time you took to
research them before contacting them. This tiny effort goes a long
way.
Action step: Do a little research on each lead before you send
them a message. We can do this ourselves, pay people to do it for
us, or use software. Batch this work. Then, use your notes to figure
out the first thing you’ll open with to feel more familiar.
b) They Don’t Trust Us→Big Fast Value. The key difference between
people who know you and strangers is…strangers give you far less
time to prove your worth. And, they need a lot more incentive to
move towards you. So make your life easier by “giving away the
farm.” We’re not trying to tickle their interest, we’re trying to blow
their minds in under thirty seconds.
Like warm reach outs, you can directly make your offer, or offer a
lead magnet, or both. It gives the person a strong reason to respond.
I specifically call out ‘big fast value’ rather than “your lead magnet”
as a reminder that it needs to be BIG FAST VALUE. If it’s not, or it’s
mediocre, you’ll blend in with the ocean of people trying to get their
attention. And they’ll treat you the same–they’ll ignore you. Here’s
how much it matters:
The first four months of cold outreach felt like torture. We offered a
game planning session as our lead magnet. Some gyms took us up on
it, but most didn’t. We needed something better. I tested many parts of
our process but swapping the lead magnet blew everything else out of
the water. We swapped from “game planning” - code for “sales call” -
to actually giving them as much free service as we could possibly
afford. Our take rates 3x’d and cold outreach became a monster
channel for us.
If your offer/lead magnet isn’t working for you, up the ante. Keep
offering more until you make it so good they feel stupid saying no.
They either buy from you or have nice things to say about you. Winwin.
If you forget everything about this chapter, remember one thing: the
goal is to demonstrate big value as fast as possible. Give yourself a
downhill battle by giving away something crazy. Give away
something for free people would normally pay for and they will want
it. Note: I didn’t say, “so good they should pay for it,” I said, “stuff
they actually pay for.” Big difference. Take this to heart and your
results will show it.
Action Step: Provide the biggest fastest value you can afford to
with your lead magnet or offer. Then, write your scripts. And don’t
worry, I got your back there. To give you a headstart, I provide
sample phone, email, and direct message scripts at the end of the
chapter. Note: Phone and chat scripts are never more than a page or
two, and cold emails rarely more than half a page. So don’t
overthink it. There are no awards for prettiest script. Get your first
100 conversations or 10,000 emails out of the way before tweaking
it. Get testing. Then tweak as you learn.
Problem #3: “I’m not getting enough chances to tell people
about my amazing stuff, what do I do?” → Volume
Once we have our list of names, personal info, and our big sexy
lead magnet, we need to get more strangers to see it. We do this in
three ways. First, we automate delivery to the greatest extent
possible. Next, we automate distribution to the greatest extent
possible. Finally, we follow up more times in more ways.
a) Automated Delivery. To the extent that we can, automating delivery
unlocks huge scale as someone doesn’t need to literally communicate
the message to the prospect. This means you get more engaged leads
per unit of time (even if fewer engage by overall percentage).
Remember, you have far more people who don’t know you than
people who do. So you don’t have to worry as much about ‘burning
through an audience.’ Here’s what the difference between manual and
automated delivery looks like.
Manual Examples: A live person can say a script to someone over the
phone. You can send a personal voice memo to each lead. A person
can write a handwritten letter to every person on the list. If it takes a
person time to convey the message each time, it’s manual.
Automated Examples: We can send a pre-recorded voice memo to
someone’s direct messages. We can send a pre-recorded voicemail to
someone’s voicemail box. We can send templated emails to an inbox
or a templated text to someone’s phone. We can send a pre-recorded
video. Etc. You record your message one time and then send the same
message to everyone.
b) Automate Distribution. Once we have our messages prepared, we
gotta distribute them. And there’s no award for who works the
hardest, only for who gets the best results. Although one leads to the
other. And as you build your skills, you will find ways to automate
portions of the work. I encourage you to automate when ethical and
available.
Manual examples: Dial each phone number. Click send on each email,
direct message, text, etc.
Automated examples: Use a robot to dial multiple numbers at a time.
Send a blast of 1000 emails, texts, voicemails at one time. Etc.
Generally speaking, you sacrifice personalization for scale. You get
a higher response rate with personalized messages. The fewer leads
you have, the less automation you should use.
For example, if there are only 1000 hedge fund managers who
meet your criteria, you’re gonna wanna personalize every one of
them. On the other hand, if you’re targeting women 25-45 trying to
lose weight, there are tens of millions of them. So you can get
away with less personalization. But…if you personalize…you’ll
get even more (wink).
Action Step. Embrace new technology. Allocate ten to twenty
percent of your effort towards brand new untested technology. For
example, if you make phone calls five days per week, try out a new
dialer or tech one of the days and see how it does compared to your
standard dialer.
c) Follow up. More times. More ways. There are two more ways you
can get more from your list of names.
First, you try to contact them more than once. Shocker. But wanna
know something crazy, most people don’t. Here’s a different way to
think about it. Imagine you really needed to get a hold of your parents
because something important came up. What would you do? You’d
probably call them, text them, leave a voicemail, etc. And if they still
haven’t responded, what would you do? You'd call and text them
again (probably shortly thereafter). It's the same way with prospects.
They are in danger of living life without your solution. Be a hero.
Save them!
The more ways you try to contact someone, the more likely you are to
contact them. People respond to different methods. For example, I
never respond to phone calls. But, I reply to direct messages far more.
Contacting someone multiple times multiple ways shows them you
are serious. And doing so quickly communicates you have something
important to discuss. Curiosity increases because they fear they're
missing out.
Personally, I like to email first. You know why? Because most people
don’t respond. If someone doesn’t respond to one of your reach out
methods, use that as a reason to follow up with another method. “Hey
I’m calling you to follow up about my email.” We either get a
response or a real reason to reach out again. We win either way.
And once you do get them booked for an appointment, expect more
than one conversation. Remember, we’re contacting complete
strangers. Outreach takes more touch points with people who don’t
know you. So expect two to three conversations before a higher ticket
sale. Shoot for less, but expect more when you start out.
Bottom line: Act like you’re actually trying to get ahold of these
people, rather than going through the motions, and you probably
will.
Action Step: Contact each lead multiple times in multiple ways.
Second, once you finish contacting your list, start back at the top
again. This actually works for three reasons.
One, because they simply may not have seen your first series of
messages. Only a fool would think one hundred percent of people
see what you put out one hundred percent of the time. So we make
up for that discrepancy with follow up.
Two, even if they do see it, it may not have been a good moment to
respond. People's schedules change every day. And there are times
when people can’t respond to you even if they wanted to. So the
more opportunities you give them to respond, the greater the
chance they will.
Three, their circumstances may have changed. They might not
have needed you then, but need you desperately now. Imagine a
person you message about losing weight before the holidays. At
that time, they fit into their ‘skinny’ jeans, so they feel no pain.
They probably wouldn’t respond. But after they gained ten lbs over
the holidays, they may all of a sudden be in desperate need of what
you offer. And now, they respond to your reach out attempt. The
only thing that changed was their circumstance. So try again in
three to six months and get an entirely new group of engaged leads
from the same list.
Everything may be right except the timing. So the more times we
contact them, the more likely we will catch them at the time
they’re ready to engage.
Action Step. After you’ve attempted to contact them multiple
times, multiple ways, wait three to six months. Then, do it again.
Three Problems Strangers Create→Solved
I wrote the book in this order to build on itself. Start with warm
reach outs. Get some reps. Post some content to grow your warm
audience. Get even more reps. Then, you’ll be ready for cold reach
outs.
And now, we solved the three core problems cold audiences create:
finding the right list of people, getting them to pay attention to you,
and getting them to engage. Victory!
Benchmarks–How well am I doing?
The two times I failed at cold outreach I hired people who never
tracked metrics well. The third person did. And cold reach outs
succeeded. The person who runs it (maybe you) has to know the
metrics of the sales process like the back of their hand. Every
single stat.
Let’s break down the numbers with a couple platform examples. I
cannot give an example for every platform because it would take
too long. My hope is that you can generalize the concept to
whatever platform you use.
Phone Example
Let’s say I make 100 cold calls per day. And, let’s say I get a
twenty percent pick-up rate. From there, I am able to get twentyfive
percent of people to want to take my lead magnet. That means
I got four engaged leads. If it took me four hours to make those
calls, it means I got one engaged lead per hour. I can do this at
first. Once the amount of engaged leads that convert to customers
makes me more than it costs to pay a cold outreach rep–I teach
someone else to do it for me (more on this in Section IV). So you
know you do well when you make at least three times the lifetime
profit of a customer compared to what it costs you to get them.
Email Example
Let’s say you send 100 personalized emails per day. From there,
thirty percent open our email. From there, 10% reply showing
interest. That means we’d have three engaged leads (30% x 10% =
3%). The numbers will vary but shoot for 3% of your list turning
into engaged leads. Here’s a sample from a new campaign for a
very niche high ticket service business in our portfolio. It shows a
4% lead engagement rate. And presumably, a third of them convert
into sales. That would net us one new customer per one hundred
outreach attempts.
Direct Message Example
Let’s say I make a personal video or record a personal voice memo
for one hundred people. I say their name and add one personal line
before delivering my standard message. From there, twenty percent
of people reply. We now have twenty engaged leads. From there
we use the same A-C-A format from the warm outreach section to
qualify them for a call and so forth. So like the phone example,
you know you do well when the cost of doing cold outreach is less
than three times what you make in profit from a customer. Note:
You can do WAY better than three times, that’s the bare minimum.
For context, the portfolio company above gets over 30:1 returns
from its outreach efforts.
Costs
This method is labor intensive. Nearly all costs are in the form of
labor. In order to calculate our return on advertising, we add up all
labor and software costs associated with steps one through three in
the section before last.
Let’s imagine we have a team doing cold calls:
We pay them $15 per hour and $50 per shown appointment or
“shows.”
We have $3600 in profit per sale.
Leads cost us ten cents.
They call 200 leads per day.
We would likely get about two shows per day from one rep.
If they worked eight hours per day, we would pay $120 in labor
and $100 in show commissions per rep and $20 for the leads.
This means we would pay $240 for two shows or $120 per
show.
If we closed 33% of shows, our cost to get a client (excluding
commissions) would be $360.
Since we get $3600 profit per new client, we would make a 10:1
return.
That’s how cold outreach works. Then, you just add bodies. It is
boring and tedious, but brutally effective.
This Sounds Hard, Why Bother?
Most people dramatically underestimate the amount of volume it
takes to use cold outreach. They also underestimate how long it
takes. But there are seven enormous benefits to using cold
outreach:
1) You don’t need to create lots of content or ads. You focus only on
one perfectly crafted message you convey to all your prospects.
Your only goal is to make that one message better every day. There
is no ‘ad fatigue’ or ‘banner blindness’ since your prospects have
never seen anything from you. So, you don't need to be a marketing
genius to make this work.
2) Your competition won’t know what you’re doing. Everything is
private. By that fact alone, you can continue to operate in secrecy.
You are not educating your competitors about how you acquire
customers. They don’t know what you're doing, or even, that you
exist.
3) It’s incredibly reliable. All you have to do to get more is do more.
A certain amount of input creates a certain number of responses. It
becomes like clockwork, bringing a reliable flow of new engaged
leads into your world. You can reverse engineer the amount of sales
you want to make to the number of inputs at the top of your lead
pathway. Eventually you’ll have an equation: for every X people
contacted, you get Y customers. Then, you simply solve for X.
Ex: Let’s say for every 100 emails, I get one customer. If I want
100 customers, I need to send 10,000 emails. That’s 333 per day.
One person can send 111 emails a day. Therefore, I need three
people sending emails every day to get 100 customers per
month.
4) Fewer platform changes. Private communication is rarely subject to
platform changes. Whereas public platforms change rules and
algorithms every day. You gotta stay on top of rule changes to
remain effective. In contrast, rules for cold calling, door knocking,
and cold email have hardly changed in thirty years.
5) Compliance is less painful. Many platforms have stringent rules
around claims you can make about the stuff you sell. Some also
ban certain industries altogether (tobacco, firearms, cannabis,
weight loss, etc.). With cold outreach, you don't need to deal with
any of this. You still need to be FTC compliant, but you don’t also
need to worry about platform rules on top. This makes life easier. If
you have a phone, you can make money. If you have an email
account, you can get leads. This makes you very hard to stop.
6) No spokesperson = Sellable business. If an investor can buy it from
you without worrying your business will stop getting customers if
you leave….your business is far more valuable. Having an
established outreach team is how we were able to sell Gym
Launch. The business could grow without me dancing in front of
the camera or relying on me being super ridiculously good looking
(ha!). I don’t think they would have wanted to buy us without it, or
at least, not for as much.
7) Hard to copy. Even if someone wants to copy your entire cold
outreach system, they’ll often need to learn how to do each step.
And, many steps are invisible. They don't know how you scrape
your lists. They don't know how you personalize your messages.
They don’t know what softwares you use to distribute the messages
etc. On top of that, they’d still need to learn how to hire, train, and
operate a team of people who can do each step. Once you have a
head start, it compounds with time. It becomes very hard to catch
you.
Your Turn
If you recall our advertising checklist this kicks off your journey to
get more engaged leads with cold outreach. You start this as you
run out of people to advertise to, or, because you just want more.
Here’s a sample.
Next Up
Now that you have set your commitment for this cold outreach
method, we move onto the last thing a single person can do to
advertise: run paid ads.
#4 Run Paid Ads Part I: Making An Ad
How To Publicly Advertise to Strangers
Advertising is the only casino where, with enough skill, you
become the house.
June 2013.
“Let’s try some Facebook ads for the gym.” I spouted.
Sam’s eyebrow went up. “They don’t work. I already tried.”
Now this was the brief time between quitting my “real job” and
starting my first gym. I wanted some experience. So I cold-emailed
more than 40 gym owners for a chance to shadow them. Sam was
the only one who responded to my pleas for mentorship. He let me
work at his gym, with him, for minimum wage. I’m forever
grateful for that opportunity.
“I promise, I really think they’ll work.” I said. “Let me give it a
shot with the stuff I learned from that workshop last weekend. I’ll
do everything.” That workshop took most of my puny savings.
Sam leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms. “I’ll tell you what.
I’ll give you a thousand bucks to play with. If you lose it, then you
have to shut up about this Facebook stuff. If you make more, I’ll
split the profit with you.”
“Deal.”
I worked with a freelancer to get everything set up. We went back
and forth until it was “perfect.” A few days later, I marched into
Sam’s office to show him what I’d made.
“It’s ready.” I said.
He spun his laptop to face me. “Alright, Hormozi. Show me what
you’ve got.”
I placed the ugliest ad you’ve ever seen:
I’M LOOKING FOR 5 CHINO HILLS RESIDENTS TO TAKE
PLACE IN A FREE 6 WEEK CHALLENGE. YOU MUST LET
US USE YOUR BEFORE AND AFTER PICTURES IN OUR
MARKETING IN EXCHANGE FOR THE PROGRAM. CLICK
LINK TO SIGN UP:
[LINK]
No images. No videos. No frills. →Just words. ALL CAPS.
The ad went live.
We got leads within hours. I called them all and booked
appointments as fast as I could. I also texted them about an hour
before to remind them of our appointment. And as soon as they
walked in, I started yapping about our six week challenge. I had
zero sales skills. My conviction made up for my lack of skill. They
bought.
I sold 19 people at $299 each. We made just under $5700 from the
$1000 investment. True to his word, Sam cut me a check and
handed it over. He made it out for $2500. More than my share.
“Sam, this is–”
He cut me off. “Nice work, Hormozi. Do it again.”
***
The “6 week challenge” became the biggest promotion in the gym
industry. For seven years. It drove at least $1.5B in revenue, more
by now. I taught it to over 4,500 gyms. And I bet more than
10,000+ gyms used versions of the promotion without licensing it.
Maybe you saw ads for it in your local market. And yes, if you’re
curious, it got more sophisticated as time went on.
How Paid Ads Work
Paid ads are a way to advertise one-to-many to cold audiences.
People who don’t know you. Paid ads work by paying another
person or business to put your offer in front of their audience.
Think of it like renting eyeballs or earballs. And because you don’t
need to spend time building an audience, paid ads are the fastest
way to get the most people to see your stuff– You trade money for
reach. A considerable advantage when you know what you’re
doing. Ads are riskier. But, when done right, they can get you more
leads than any other method.
With warm and cold outreach we have to do more stuff to reach
more people. To reach more people with free content, we depend
on the platform or audience sharing it if they feel like it. Paid ads
are different. The reach is guaranteed. But getting your money
back isn’t. So it’s a game of efficiency rather than reach. Let me
explain:
In principle, if you paid enough money, you could get every person
in the world to see your ad. And, if every person in the world saw
your ad, someone would buy. Even if only by accident (ha). So the
question isn’t “do ads work?” it’s “how well can you make them
work?” In other words, it’s a push and pull between how much you
spend and how much they buy.
And like cold outreach, paid ads go to colder lower trust audiences.
So even with good offers, a smaller percentage of people will
respond. And like cold outreach, paid ads get over this hurdle by
putting your offer in front of more people. And if an ad isn’t
profitable, most of the time, it’s because the right people never saw
it. So to make an ad profitable, the right people have to see it. This
keeps our ads efficient.
This chapter reveals how I create more efficient paid ads by
finding needles in the haystack. I start with the entire world as my
audience (haystack) then narrow down to get a higher percentage
of engaged leads (needles). First, I pick a platform that contains
my ideal audience. Second, I use whatever targeting methods that
exist within the platform to find them. Third, I craft my ad in a way
that repels anyone else. Finally, I tell whoever’s left standing to
take the next step. People overcomplicate it. But that’s it. That’s all
we’re doing - narrowing down who sees our ad so we have the
highest chance of getting the right type of people to respond.
Once we advertise profitably in a small puddle of an audience, we
expand to a pond, then a lake, then an ocean. And as the audience
gets bigger it does have more of the wrong people, but it has more
of the right ones too. So ads decrease in efficiency, but at that point
you can afford it. In other words, the ratio between what you spend
and how much they buy goes down but the total amount of money
you make goes up. So instead of spending $1000 to make $10,000
with $9000 in profit, you spend $100,000 to make $300,000 with
$200,000 in profit. Your ratio goes down, but you make more
money. So the risk is higher because you spend more. But so is the
reward. This means we want to make the audience as big as
possible while still turning a profit.
Paid ads give us four new problems to solve. Let’s break them
down together:
1) Knowing where to advertise
2) Getting the right audience to see it
3) Making the best ad for them to see
4) Getting permission to contact them
Step 1: “But where do I advertise?” → Find a platform where
these four things are true
Platforms distribute content to an audience. If you’re not familiar
with any available platforms, I invite you to come join me on
planet earth. If you’ve ever consumed content, which you have,
you’ve directly or indirectly used a platform and been a member of
its audience. And wherever there’s an audience, you can usually
advertise. So if you want to become a great entrepreneur, you have
to learn about them. Here’s what I look for in a platform I want to
advertise on:
I've used it and gotten value from it as a consumer. So I have
some idea how it works.
I can target people on the platform interested in my stuff.
I know how to format ads specific to the platform (which I’ll
dive into in step three).
I have the minimum amount of money to spend to place an ad.
...And yes, platforms change all the time, but these principles stay
the same.
Action Steps: Start with one platform that meets the four
requirements. And start watching, listening, or reading ads on the
platform as a first step to learning how to make one.
Step #2: “But how do I get the right people to see it?” →
Target them
So if we start with the entire world, which we kinda do, we need to
be a bit more specific. For example, if you choose a platform that
has 100,000,000 users, you’ve already cut out 99% of the world–
right off the bat. And, if everyone who buys from you speaks
English, you also want to exclude the audiences within the
platform who don't. If that’s half the platform’s users, you’re
already at 99.5% of the world excluded. Specific is good.
The right message to the wrong audience will fall on deaf ears. It
doesn’t matter how good your ads are. If you’re marketing to
Florida residents about a local business in Iowa, it’s probably not
gonna work. So you have only one goal when targeting–get the
highest number of people you think will buy your stuff to see your
ad.
We did our first round of targeting by selecting our platform. We
do the second round within the platform itself. Modern advertising
platforms have two ways to target. You can use them separately or
combine them:
1) Target a lookalike audience. Modern platforms can show your ad
to an audience that is similar to, and much bigger than, a list you
provide. Advertisers call this a lookalike audience. Modern
platforms will make lookalike audiences for you so long as you
upload their minimum list size. The bigger the list and the higher
quality the contacts, the more responsive the lookalike audience
will be. Start with your list of current and previous customers. If
your customer list is big enough to meet the platform minimum,
use it. If it’s not big enough, add your warm reach out list. If it’s
still not big enough, add your cold reach out leads to hit the
minimum. This is exactly what I do. Forcing the list to the right
size sometimes makes the lookalike audience too broad. And
that’s OK because you can…
2) Target with factors of your choosing. Targeting options include:
age, income, gender, interests, time, location, etc. For example,
if you know no one over forty-five or below twenty-five has
ever bought your thing, then exclude anyone outside that range.
If you sell car parts then show your ad during car shows and on
car channels. If only people with pets buy your thing, then
include pets as an interest. Basic filters on top of the platformgenerated
lookalike audience are a simple way to get more of
the right people to see your ads. End result: more efficient ads.
The more filters you use, the more specific the list. The more
specific the list, the more efficient your ads but the faster you will
“burn” through it. However, this specificity sets you up to get more
wins early on. The wins from smaller specific audiences now give
you the money to advertise to larger and broader audiences later.
This is how you scale.
Action Steps: Bring all your lead lists together into one place.
Separate them by past and previous customers, warm outreach, and
cold outreach. Eventually, you’ll have a list of people that engaged
with your paid ads by giving you contact information but didn’t
buy. That’ll come in handy. Then, if the platform allows, use these
lists in order of quality to create your lookalike audience. Then, if
the platform also allows, add filters on top of your lookalike
audience to target an even higher percentage of people to engage
with your ad. If you are incapable of making a lookalike audience,
then simply start by targeting interests.
Step #3 “But what should my ad say?” → Call Out + Value +
Call to Action (CTA)
To this day, I don’t change the channel when I see an ad. I rarely
mute ads or skip ads. In fact, I have no premium subscriptions that
remove ads on any media platforms either. Main reason: I want to
consume the ads. I want to see how businesses do three things. 1)
How they call out their ideal customers. 2) How they present the
value elements. 3) How they give their audience a call to action.
When I look at ads this way, it turns what was once an everyday
nuisance (ads) into a continuous learning experience. Consuming
ads on purpose, with the core elements in mind, makes me a better
advertiser. And it will make you a better one too.
Let’s use the three chunks to make an ad.
1) Call Outs - I need to get them to notice my ad
2) Value - I need to get them interested in what I have to offer
3) Calls to Action - I need to tell them what to do next
1) Call Out: People noticing your ad is the most important part of the
ad…by a lot.
The purpose of each second of the ad is to sell the next second of the
ad. And the headline is the first sale. As David Ogilvy says “After
you’ve written your headline, you’ve spent eighty cents of your
advertising dollar.” Focus your effort front to back. As crazy as this
sounds (and all the pros are nodding their heads), my advertising
became 20x more effective when I focused the majority of my effort
on the first five seconds. We need the audience’s eyes and ears just
long enough for them to realize “this is for me, I’ll keep paying
attention.” This “first impression” is the part of the ad I test the most.
Imagine you’re at a cocktail party in a big ballroom. Lots of people
talking in groups. Loud music playing in the background. In all that
noise, a single sound pierces through it all and you turn around.
Wanna know the sound? Your name. You hear it, and instantly look
for the source.
Scientists call it the ‘cocktail party effect’. In simple terms, even when
there’s tons of stuff going on, a single thing can still catch and hold
our attention. So our goal with callouts is to harness the cocktail party
effect and cut through all the noise. After all, if they never notice your
ad, nothing else matters.
A callout is whatever you do to get the attention of your audience.
Call outs go from hyperspecific - to get one person’s attention - to not
at all specific - to get everyone’s attention. Let me explain. If someone
drops a tray of dishes, everyone looks. If a child yells “MOM!”, then
the moms look. If someone says your name, only you look. But again,
they all get attention. And I try to make my call outs specific enough
to get the right people and broad enough to get as many of them as I
can. So pay close attention to how advertisers use call outs, especially
the ones targeting your audience.
Here’s what I look for with verbal callouts- using words to get
attention:
1) Labels: A word or set of words putting people into a group. These
include features, traits, titles, places, and other descriptors. Ex:
*Clark County Moms* *Gym Owners* *Remote Workers* *I’m
looking for XYZ* etc. To be most effective, your ideal customers
need to identify with the label.
a) People automatically identify with their local area. So with
local ads, the more local, the better. A local ad with “LOCAL
AREA + TYPE OF PERSON” callout is still one of my alltime
favorite ways to get someone’s attention. It worked two
hundred years ago, it works today, and it’ll work tomorrow.
So think: Americans < Texans < Dallas Residents < Irving
Residents. If you live in Irving, you’ll immediately think this
ad could affect you. So, it catches your attention.
2) Yes-Questions: Questions where if people answer “yes, that’s me”
they qualify themselves for the offer. Ex: *Do you wake up to pee
more than once a night?* *Do you have trouble tying your shoes?*
*Do you have a home worth over $400,000?*
3) If-Then Statements: If they meet your conditions then you help
them make a decision. *If you run over $100,000 per month in ads,
we can save you 20% or more... *If you were born between 1978
and 1986 in Muskogee Oklahoma, you may qualify for a class
action lawsuit…*If you want to XYZ, then pay attention…*
4) Ridiculous Results: Bizarre, rare, or out of the ordinary stuff
someone would want. *Massage studio books out two years in
advance. Clients furious.* *This woman lost 50 pounds eating
pizza and fired her trainer* *The government is handing out
thousand dollar checks to anyone who can answer three questions*
Etc.
Callouts don’t have to be just words. They can also be noises or
visuals in the environment. Let’s go back to the cocktail party.
Sure, a dropped tray of dishes would get everyone’s attention, but
so would the cling*cling*cling* of a knife against a champagne
flute. They both get everyone’s attention for different reasons–one
signals an embarrassing disaster and the other signals important
news… but, in either case, everyone still wants to know what
happens next. So if the platform allows, good advertisers use
verbal and nonverbal callouts together.
Here’s what I look for with nonverbal callouts- using the setting
and spokesperson to get attention:
1) Contrast: Any stuff that “sticks out” in the first few seconds.
The colors. The sounds. The movements etc. Note what
catches your attention. Ex:
a) A bright shirt almost always gets more attention than a
black or dull shirt.
b) Attractive people almost always get more attention than
plain looking people.
c) Moving stuff almost always gets more attention than
still stuff.
2) Likeness: Think visually showing labels–features, traits, titles,
places, and other descriptors that people identify with.
a) People want to work with people who look, talk, and act
in ways familiar to them (and you may not look, talk, or
act in ways familiar to them). So if you serve a broad
customer base use more ethnicities, ages, genders,
personalities etc. in your ads. If you serve a narrow
customer base (ex: medical devices for seniors), then
use people who look like them.
i) Quack like a duck. If you want to attract ducks,
look like a duck, walk like a duck, and quack like
a duck. If you want to attract plumbers, dress like
a plumber, talk like a plumber, be in a plumbing
environment. Even with the same message, your
ad will do far better if you look the part (or find
people who do).
ii) If you see an ad for doctors, notice the
spokesperson. What age are they? Gender?
Ethnicity? Are they wearing a lab coat? A
stethoscope? Are they in a medical facility? All
these things get a specific type of person
interested in health related products and services
to pay more attention than they would have
otherwise.
iii) Mascots also work well because they don’t age,
never ask for more money, and never take days
off. Think Micky Mouse for Disney. The Geico
Gecko. Tony the Tiger for Kellogg’s. The
Michelin Man. etc. A mascot is a great way to
create an enduring spokesperson for your
business.
iv) Advanced: Whichever likenesses you choose to
use, if it’s not you, the business becomes less
dependent on you and therefore more sellable.
You also may just be an ugly son of a gun. Plus,
pretty people convert better anyways. Good news
is, it doesn’t cost much to get a pretty person to
say stuff to a camera.
3) The Scene: Think showing the Yes-Questions and If-Then
statements.
Ex: An ad with…
a) A person tossing and turning in bed calls out people
with sleep troubles.
b) A pear next to an hourglass can call out people with a
pear shaped body.
c) A room full of stuff stacked to the ceiling calls out
people with too much junk.
d) A rock hitting a window calls out people with broken
windows.
e) A local landmark. Locals think - “Hey, I know that
place!” and pay attention.
Now, this isn’t an exhaustive list. Far from it. I show you these to
pull back the curtain. This way, you can see the infinite ways
advertisers cut through the noise, so you can too.
Action Step: I’m always impressed with the clever and innovative
ways advertisers call out their prospects. So instead of muting or
hitting “skip ad” look for the call outs. Become a student of the
game. My goal is that for the rest of your life when you see an ad
you turn up the volume.
Now, once they’ve noticed our ad, it leads us to the second chunk
of the ad–we need to get them interested…
2) Get Them Interested. If people think an offer or lead magnet has big
benefits and tiny costs, they value it. And they’ll exchange money or
contact information to get it. But if the cost outweighs the benefits,
they don’t value it, and they won’t. So the best ads make the benefits
look as big as possible and the costs look as small as possible. This
makes an offer or lead magnet as valuable as it can be and gets the
most engaged leads because of it.
A good advertisement, paid or not, uses clear and simple ways to
answer the question: why should I be interested in your thing? It tells
people why they should want your lead magnet or offer. Now, there
are a million ways to do this, but I’ll share with you my What-WhoWhen
Framework. This mental framework hinges on knowing the
value equation forwards and backwards. So all you have to do is
know eight key things about your own product or service: how it
fulfills each element of value for your prospect, and how it helps them
avoid their hidden costs (remember those?). Think of them like carrots
vs sticks. How your offer delivers more good stuff and less bad stuff.
Then think of the perspectives of the people who would experience
them (Who). And finally, what time period (When) they’d have these
experiences (positive or negative).
In the words of David Ogilvy “The customer isn’t a moron. She’s
your wife.” So you know what that means? Write to her. Ads cause
the prospect to think questions to themselves. And a good ad answers
those questions at precisely the time they think it. So if you can
answer what they’re thinking with your ad, using the words they’d
use, you’ve won.
So let’s start with The What: Eight Key Elements
● Dream Outcome: A good ad will show and tell the maximum
benefit the prospect can achieve using the thing you sell. It
should align with the ideal prospect’s dream outcome for that
sort of product or service. These are the results they
experience after buying the thing.
○ Opposite - Nightmare: A good ad will also show them
the worst possible hassles, pain, etc. of going without
your solution. In short - the bad stuff they’ll experience
if they don’t buy.
● Perceived Likelihood of Achievement: Because of past
failures, we assume that even when we buy, there’s a risk we
don’t get what we want. Lower perceived risk by minimizing
or explaining away past failures, emphasizing the success of
people like them, giving assurances by authority, guarantees,
and how what you have to offer will at least give them a
better chance of success than what they currently do, etc.
○ Opposite - Risk: A good ad will also show them how
risky it is to not act. What will their life be like if they
carried on as they always have? Show how they will
repeat their past failures and how their problems will
get bigger and worse…
● Time Delay: A good ad will also show them how slow their
current trajectory is or that they’ll never get what they want at
their current rate…
○ Opposite - Speed: To get things we want - we know we
have to spend time getting them. A good ad will show
and tell how much faster they will get the thing they
want.
● Effort and Sacrifice: A good ad will also show them the
amount of work and skill they’ll need to get the result without
your solution. And, how they’ll be forced to keep giving up
the things they love and continue suffering from the things
they hate. Or worse, that they work hard and sacrifice a ton
right now… and have gotten…nowhere. In other words, they
waste more time and money doing what they currently do
than if they just bought our darn solution!
○ Opposite - Ease: To get things we want - we know we
have to change something. But we then assume we have
to do stuff we hate and give up stuff we love. And ease
comes from a lack of needed work or skill. A good ad
disproves the assumption. It tells and shows how you
can avoid the stuff you hate doing, do more of the stuff
you love doing, without working hard, or having a lot of
skill and still get the dream outcome.
Those are the 8 key elements. Now we fully understand The What
– how we deliver the four value elements, and how we avoid their
four opposites. We now go to the next W - The Who.
Who: Humans are primarily status driven. And the status of one
human comes from how the other humans treat them. So if your
product or service changes how other people treat your customer,
which it does in some way, it pays to show how. And talking about
the value elements from someone else’s perspective shows all the
ways it'll improve the status of your customer. So we want to
outline two groups of people. The first group is the people gaining
status, your customers. The second group is the people giving it to
them: Spouse, Kids, Parents, Extended Family, Colleagues,
Bosses, Friends, Rivals, Competitors, etc.
All of these perspectives give us different opportunities to show
how the prospect’s status may improve. And - they give us a ton of
bonus benefits. As in, if you lose weight, do your kids have a new
role model? Does your spouse now decide to get healthy too? Are
you more likely to get promoted at work? Science says - yes. Does
your frenemy no longer make those little jabs at dinner?
Let’s do business examples. If I said something was risk free, I
want to spell out how their spouse won’t nag them about the
purchase since there’s no risk. I’d talk about how their kids would
notice they weren’t as stressed or distracted anymore about work.
How their competitors notice their phones don’t ring as much
because all their customers are flowing to your new customer. How
their business owner buddies say “business must be good” when
they pull up in their new car at the golf range. You get the idea.
These are all added benefits to the prospect we’d miss out on if we
only looked at it from their own perspective.
And, we can apply each new who perspective to each value driver.
This is how you get so many different stories, examples, angles,
etc., to describe the benefits (more carrot and less stick).
That leads me to the third lens of the What-Who-When framework
- The When.
When: People often only think of how their decisions affect the
here and now. But if we want to be extra compelling (and we do),
we should also explain what their decisions led to in the past and
what their decisions could lead to in the future. We do this by
getting them to visualize through their own timeline (past–present–
future). This way, we help them to see the consequences of their
decision (or indecision) right now.
Let’s use the weight loss example from earlier from their
perspective. We’d show them getting teased as a kid (past)
struggling to button their favorite pair of jeans (present) or moving
up yet another belt loop (future). What does that nightmare look
like to their spouse? To their rivals? How embarrassing!
Remember, we can also run the same timeline through someone
else’s perspective. Their kid asking why other kids make fun of
them (because they passed on bad food habits) (past), or how their
kids complain now that the other kids’ dads participate at practice
when they don’t (present), or how their doctor said they might not
walk their daughter down the aisle at her wedding (future). Note:
this is all the bad stuff they want to avoid. Our next copy elements
would contrast those with the good stuff that could happen (present
and future) if they buy our thing.
We use both towards good stuff and away from bad stuff then
combine it with the past, present, and future of the prospect’s life
to create powerful motivators in our copy.
Putting the What, the Who, and the When together, we answer
WHY they should be interested.
If I continued on with the weight loss thing, I might talk about
how:
Their spouse (WHO) will perceive how fast (WHAT) they fit into
‘that suit your wife loves that didn’t fit but does now’ in the future
(WHEN). Or, how their kids (WHO) month after month (WHEN)
got more interested in eating healthy and tagging along during
workouts (WHAT). Or, how they (WHO) catch a look at
themselves in a reflection in the mall in a few months (WHEN) and
realize ‘stuff actually fits me in this store’ (WHAT).
When we combine:
everything we can to get the prospect going toward the four
value drivers, while also getting them away from their opposites
the many perspectives we can show them gaining status, and
different timelines for each…
…This adds up to why they should be interested. And now we have
a lot of ways to get them interested! And - the more angles we
cover, the more interested they’ll become.
Also - since you asked - the only difference between long ads and
short ads is how many angles we have time to cover from the
copywriting framework. Longer ads use more. Shorter ads use
fewer. So add or take away based on the platform, but keep the
callouts (the first few seconds) and CTAs (what to do next) the
same.
Action Steps: Get as many advertising angles with your offer as
you can with the What-Who-When framework.
What: Know the eight key things about your own product or
service. How it fulfills each element of value, and how it helps
avoid their opposites.
Who: Show how the eight key things about your product or service
can change your prospect’s status. Then, show how the people they
know give status to the prospect when they buy your thing or take
status away if they don’t.
When: Get the prospect to see the consequences of buying and not
buying through their past, present, and future. Especially through
their change in status with people they know. This way, we help
them to see the value of their decision (or indecision) at this very
moment.
I also include a few more ad tips and tricks that have served me
well in the lessons at the end of the chapter. But even if you never
use them, there’s only one more thing you’ll need to turn these
interested folks into engaged leads…
3) CTA - Tell Them What To Do Next
If your ad got them interested, then your audience will have huge
motivation… for a tiny time. Take advantage. Tell them exactly
what to do next. S-P-E-L-L it out: Click this button. Call this
number. Reply with “YES.” Go to this website. Scan this QR Code
(wink). So many ads still don’t do this. Your audience can only
know what to do if you tell them.
Make CTAs quick and easy. Easy phone numbers, obvious buttons,
simple websites. For example, a common CTA is to direct the
audience to a website. So make your web address short and
memorable:
Instead of… alexsprivateequityfirm.com/free-book-and-course2782
Use.. acquisition.com/training
Note: This comes from a guy who spent $370,000 on a single word
domain Acquisition.com. So, I may overvalue easy domains, but I
don’t think I do. I think everyone else undervalues them. Just my
two cents.
Beyond these basics which most still forget, you can also use all
the tactics like urgency, scarcity, and bonuses from “Step 7” from
the “engage your leads” chapter to make even stronger CTAs. They
apply here, and everywhere else you tell your audience to do
something.
So we can now pick a platform to advertise on, target who we
show our ads to, make the ads they see, and tell them what to do
next. All we have to do now is get their contact information.
Step #4 “How do I get their info?” → Get Permission To
Contact Them
After they take the action–Get. Their. Contact. Information. My
favorite way to get contact information is a simple landing page.
Don’t overthink it. The simpler your landing page, the easier it is
to test. Focus on the words and the image. Here are my three
favorite templates. Pick one and start testing.
And make your landing pages match your ads. People click an ad
because you promised them some benefit. So carry that same look
and language over to your landing page. Make sure what you
promised in your ad is what you deliver. This sounds simple, but a
lot of people forget, and waste money until they remember it. You
don’t want to end up with some Frankenstein experience where
everything looks different. You want a continuous experience from
“click to close.”
Get more people through more steps. In Robert Cialdini’s seminal
work, Influence, he shows that people like to think of themselves
as consistent. So, if you remind them of the action they just took
(CTA), and show how taking the next action aligns with it, you’ll
get more people to take the second action (Contact Info). For
example, “Now that you just did A, you need to do B to get the
most of A.” Or “Doing A makes you a ‘doing A’ kind of person.
Doing A kind of people, do B.”
To be clear, we aren’t selling anything. We are asking if they’re
interested in the stuff we sell. And if they’re interested, they’ll give
us a way to tell them more about it. And when they do, they
become engaged leads. Woo!
Action Step: Build your first landing page. I wasted four years
feeling too scared to make a landing page. When I finally tried, I
finished before lunch. Nowadays there are tons of “drag and drop”
tools to build websites in minutes. And if you’re still worried about
it, freelancers will build a site, probably using those same drag and
drop tools, on the cheap. So just get it done.
→Now, you have engaged leads from paid ads! Hooray! We did
it!
Run Paid Ads Part I Conclusion
What has to happen for advertising to work? Well, we have to
show our ad to the right people. So, we pick the right platform and
target the people within that platform that have the highest
percentage of our audience. Once we do that, we have to get them
to notice our ad. Once they notice it, they have to consume it to get
a reason to take action now rather than later. We do that using the
value equation. And demonstrate it in the past, present and future,
from their perspective and the perspectives of the people they
know. And once they have a reason to take action, they have to
have a way to give us permission to contact them. That action
turns them into an engaged lead. And since those things gotta
happen, they slowly but surely became the three core elements of
every ad I create:
1) Callouts (for them to notice it)
2) Value Elements (to give them reason to do something)
3) Calls to action (to give them a way to do it)
Now… only one question remains…how efficient are we? Let’s
talk about money stuff.
#4 Run Paid Ads Part II: Money Stuff
“I’m just trying to buy a dolla’ and sell it for two” - Proposition
Joe, The Wire
We focus on efficiency with paid ads throughout this chapter and
the last one because efficiency matters more than creativity. All
advertising works. The only thing that differs between
advertisements is how well they work. Maybe people get crazy
about making paid ads because they have words like “copy” and
“creative” and “media” then get hyper-focused on getting all that
stuff “perfect” (as if you can). You can tweak all day and night…
until the cows come home! The reality is that paid ads, any
advertising really, is all about the return on your investment. And
with paid ads it gets clear as day because you put X dollars in for
people to see the ad and get Y dollars out if they buy your stuff. So
if you want a $100M leads machine, you just need to get it "good
enough" to scale. Why? Because good enough is good enough.
Since efficiency matters most, we want to be as efficient as
possible so we can scale as much as possible. That way, we get as
many leads as our little heart’s desire.
That being said, there’s enough nuance to scaling paid ads that it
felt better to break it into its own chapter. This chapter answers
four big questions about ads as I understand them:
How much do I spend? →Three Phases of Scaling Ads
How do I know how well I’m doing? →Cost & Benchmarks
If my ads aren’t profitable, how do I fix it? →Client Financed
Acquisition.
What do I wish I had known before I ran my first paid ad?
→Lessons
“But how much do I spend on paid ads?”→ The Three Phases
of Scaling Paid Ads
There are three stages to spending money on ads as I see it.
Phase One: Track Money
Phase Two: Lose Money
Phase Three: Print Money
Let’s break them down together.
Phase One: Track Money. Before spending a dollar on ads, set
everything up so you can accurately track your returns. If you
don’t track, you’re gonna get cleaned out. It would be like going to
a casino and playing your favorite game for as long as you felt like
it rather than for as long as you could afford it. But, once you have
tracking, you can do more of the stuff that makes you money and
less of the stuff that doesn't. It rigs the game in your favor. So get a
consultant, watch tutorials, and get it set up. End of story. Once
you have the tracking, you can start losing money like a pro
(wink).
Phase Two: Lose money (half-joking). I prefer to call it ‘investing
in a money printing machine.’ After all, when running paid ads,
you pay first. So your bank account has to go down before it comes
up.
I emphasize this because I'd rather prepare you: you’re gonna lose
money. In fact, I've lost money more times than I’ve made money
running paid ads. But every time I make money with paid ads, I
make back everything I lost, and then a bunch more. So the
number of times I lose is high but the amount I lose is low because
I know when to shut it down. And my number of wins is low but
the amount I win is very high because I know when to hit the gas.
So, think of it like this.
Imagine I spend $100 on ten ads - $1,000 in total. Nine of them
lose all $100. Then, one of them makes $500 back for the $100 I
spent. I’m still down $500. Many people stop here because they
see a $500 dollar loss. But not us. We see a winner. So now we
buckle up and 100x down. We spend $10,000 on the winning ad
and make $50,000 back.
Note: I still lost nine times, but the one time I won, I won big. And
this is important, because you might lose, nine or ninety-nine times
in a row before you win big. But, to win big, you have to see the
winners and double, triple, quadruple, 10x down on them. This is
why paid advertising is a lot like a casino. You’ll often lose in the
beginning to learn the game. But - with enough skill - you
eventually become the house. That being said, during this “lose
money” phase, you can still be smart about it. Here’s how I do it.
I budget two times the cash I collect from a customer in thirty
days (not LTGP) when testing new ads. I wasted tons of money
letting ads run too long before I realized they sucked. But on the
flipside, I’ve lost even more money by giving up on ads before I
gave them a chance. Eventually, I hit a sweet spot by budgeting
two times the cash I collected from a new customer in the first
thirty days to test a new ad. For example, if I know I make $100 in
profit from a customer in the first thirty days, I’ll let an ad go up to
$200 in spend before shutting it off (as long as I’m getting leads).
If I’m not getting any leads from an ad at all, before I spend 1x
thirty-day cash I shut it off ($100 in the example).
It costs money to build an advertising machine. I worked with a
business that took a year to get paid ads profitable. It was tough.
But other businesses in their space ran profitable ads which meant
we could too. Once they were profitable, they made their year’s
worth of ‘wasted’ money back in the next month. It costs money to
build an advertising machine…and that’s normal. Just make sure
you measure the returns over a long time horizon, not next week.
Can you think of anything more valuable than a machine that
prints money? It would be unreasonable for it be cheap (or easy).
Once you start making more money than it costs you to make it,
you’re in phase three.
Phase Three: Print Money. If you’re making back more money
than you spend - the answer is simple - spend as much as you can.
After all, if you had a magic machine that gave you $10 for every
$1 you put into it, what would your budget be? Right. All the
money. But realistically, you probably have some other constraint
on your business that prevents you from unlimited customers
coming in. So here’s how I scale my budget.
Instead of asking “How much money should I spend on an ad?” I
ask “How many customers do I want?” or “How many customers
can I handle?” So once ads break even or better, I reverse my
budget from my sales goals. If I can only handle 100 customers
next month, and customers cost me $100 to get, I‘d need to spend
$10,000 to get them (100 x $100). But since ads get less efficient
as they scale, I usually pad the budget by twenty percent. So that
means $12,000 over thirty days, or $400 per day in ad spend. I
reverse my daily ad budget from my lead-getting goal. Then, I
commit to it. If the number terrifies you, then you’re doing it right.
Trust the data. This is how you scale. And that’s why most people
never do.
“How well am I doing?” - Cost & Returns - Efficiency
Benchmarks
Efficient paid ads make more money than they cost. If that sounds
painfully obvious, good. You’ve already got most people beat. I
measure paid ad efficiency by comparing the lifetime gross profit
of a customer (LTGP) with the cost to acquire a customer (CAC). I
express this ratio as LTGP to CAC.
I Measure LTGP Instead of “Lifetime Value” or “LTV”
Lifetime gross profit is all the money a customer ever spends on
your stuff minus all the money it takes to deliver it. For example, if
a customer buys something for $15 and it costs $5 to deliver it,
your gross profit is $10. So if that customer buys ten things over
their lifetime, then they bought a total of $150 in stuff. But it cost
you a total of $50 to deliver that stuff. That makes the lifetime
gross profit $100.
Gross profit is important in general because it's the actual money
you use to acquire customers, pay rent, cover payroll, and...
everything else to run your business.
So if you’ve ever heard me say “I’m getting 3 to 1 on this” I refer
to my LTGP-to-CAC ratio. I compare how much I made against
how much I spent. So if LTGP is greater than CAC, you have
profitable advertising. If it’s lower than CAC, you’re losing money.
What's a good LTGP to CAC ratio? Every business I invest in that
struggles to scale has at least one thing in common - their LTGP to
CAC ratio was less than 3 to 1. As soon as I get it above 3 to 1
(either through decreasing CAC or increasing LTGP), they take
off. This is a pattern I personally observed, not a rule.
You have two big levers to improving LTGP:CAC:
Make CAC lower - Get cheaper customers. We do this with
more efficient ads following the steps we just outlined.
Make LTGP higher - Increase how much you make per
customer. We do this with a better business model.
For maximum money… I prefer to do both.
For example, if you made a billion dollars per customer, then you
could spend nine hundred and ninety-nine million dollars to get a
customer and still have a million dollars leftover. You could spend
pretty much whatever it takes to get a customer. No matter how
crappy your ads - you’d still probably win. On the flip side, if you
made one cent per customer, you’d have to get each customer for
less than a penny to make it work. Even with the best ads, you’d
fail.
I bring this up because we speak with hundreds of entrepreneurs
every month. They often think they have crappy ads (high CAC)
when, in reality, they have a crappy business model (Low LTGP).
Here’s a finding that will probably surprise you as much as it
surprised me. The cost to acquire customers, between competitors
in the same industry, is much closer than you’d think. The
difference between the winners and the losers is how much they
make off each customer.
So how do you know if it’s your ads or your business model that
needs work? I use the industry average CAC as my guide.
Research your industry averages for the cost to acquire customers.
If your CAC is below 3x your industry average (good), focus on
your business model (LTGP). If your CAC is above 3x the average
(bad), focus on your advertising (CAC).
Things can only get so cheap. Eventually you just gotta make
more. Think about it like this– lowering the cost of getting a
customer by $100 will eventually take more work than making an
extra $100 from them. So once your cost is low enough, focus on
your business model. Costs can only approach zero but how much
you make can go up to infinity. Increasing advertising efficiency
beyond a certain point is like trying to “save your way” to a billion
dollars. You feel like you’re making progress, but you’re never
gonna get there.
“My ads aren’t profitable, how do I fix it?” → Client Financed
Acquisition
For many businesses, LTGP is bigger than CAC. Yay. But not after
the first purchase. Boo. The profit from the customer’s first
purchase is often less than the cost to get them. It can take many
months to collect the full LTGP. So you get your money later
instead of now. This cash flow problem cripples your ability to
scale ads and get more customers. Boo again.
But… if your customer spends more than it costs you to get and
fulfill them–in the first 30 days–then you have the funds to scale
now and forever. I call this client financed acquisition.
I pick thirty days because any business can get interest free money
for thirty days in the form of a credit card. And if we make more
than the cost to get and fulfill the customer in the first thirty days,
we square our balance. Now, we have zero debt and a new
customer which we can keep profiting from forever. Then, we
repeat the process. Money is no longer your bottleneck. This is the
key to limitless scale. I repeat the same image above so you can
reference it.
Let’s see client financed acquisition in action:
Say we have a $15 per month membership that costs us $5 to
deliver. That leaves us $10 gross profit left over.
($15 membership) - ($5 cost) = $10 gross profit per month
And let’s say our average member stays for ten months. That
makes our lifetime gross profit $100.
($10 gross profit per month) x (10 months) = $100 LTGP.
If the cost to get a customer is $30 (CAC = $30), we have a
3.3:1 LTGP : CAC ratio.
($100 LTGP) / ($30 CAC) = 3.3 LTGP / 1 CAC → 3.3:1
Our ads make money. Hooray.
But wait…there’s a problem. You spent $30 in ads and only got
$10 back. Ten bucks trickles in, one month at a time, until you
finally break even…two. months. later. That’s tough! Make no
mistake, you should 100% make that trade. But, now we have a
cash flow problem.
Here’s the way I fix it- I immediately sell them more stuff
If I offer a $100 upsell (with 100% margins) that one in five new
customers take. That adds $20 of gross profit per customer.
($100 upsell) /(5 customers) = $20 average upsell dollars per
customer.
This takes us from $10 to $30 in the first thirty days (our breakeven
window). The first purchase is $10. But now the average
upsell adds $20.
$10 + $20 = $30 gross profit per customer in less than 30
days.
And since it costs $30 to acquire them, we break even. Great!
$30 CAC - $30 cash collected within thirty days = free
customers!
Every $10 a month that comes in thereafter is “gravy.” Now, I can
go get another customer while I keep collecting that $10 profit per
month for the next nine months. This is how you print money. The
things you can sell or upsell are unlimited.
If I cover the cost to get and fulfill a customer in the first thirty
days I can pay off my card, then do it again. It’s how I’ve scaled
every company I’ve started for the past seven years past $1M/mo
in the first twelve months - without outside funding. With
efficiency out of the way, creativity is your only limit.
Bottom Line: Figure out a way to get your customers to pay you
back in the first thirty days so you can recycle your cash to get
more customers.
Personal Lessons from Paid Ads
1. Don’t Confuse Sales Problems With Advertising Problems.
The cost to get customers doesn’t only come from advertising (it
just mostly does)… For example, a company I invested in spent
twelve weeks and $150,000 to run paid ads. They were getting
the right leads on the phone, but they weren’t buying. The owner
said advertising didn’t work. But the ads worked fine, great
even, their sales sucked. The owner threw up his hands and gave
up…six inches from gold. Frustrating. Confusing an advertising
problem with a sales problem cost them an estimated ~$30M in
enterprise value. If your engaged leads have the problem you
solve and the money to spend, and they’re not buying, then your
ads work fine–you have a sales problem.
2. Your Best Free Content Can Make The Best Paid Ads. Some
of the best paid ads I’ve ever run came from free content. If you
make a free content piece that generates sales, or performs very
well, nine times out of ten it’ll make a great paid ad.
a. User Generated Content (UGC). If you can get your
customers to create testimonials or reviews using your
product, post them. If they perform well as free content,
they often make killer ads too. Having a system in place
to encourage these public posts from customers is my
favorite way of getting a steady stream of potential ads.
And - the best part is - it’s no extra work.
3. If You Say You Suck At Something, You Will Probably Suck
At It. Never say “I’m not techy” or “I hate tech stuff.” It just
keeps you poorer than you should be. I said it for…wait for it…
FOUR YEARS. Then one day, I snapped because I hated my
website designer more than I hated tech itself. “If this idiot can
do it, so can I.” Four years of wasting time and lost money
reversed with four hours of concentrated effort.
Your turn
I can teach you how to place an ad in twenty minutes. It’ll cost ya
$100. Worth it? I hope so. It’s an important skill. It won’t make
you money, but you will learn a lesson worth far more than a
hundred bucks - running ads is easier than you think. In fact,
platforms spend zillions to make it as easy as possible (so they can
make more money). Here’s all you gotta do:
Search “HOW TO PLACE A [PLATFORM] AD.” Then place one
for $100. Don’t go all the way to the end then chicken out. Spend
the gosh darn money. Rip off the bandaid. As soon as you do -
you’re no longer an observer, you're in the game.
Once you have put all these pieces together, it’s time to send it.
Spend money. Start with an acceptable amount of money you are
willing to lose each month. Expect to lose it. You won’t be earning,
you’ll be learning.
If you recall our advertising checklist, you’ll need to pick each line
to fill out your action card. This kicks off your journey in paid ads
to get more engaged leads. Sample Paid Ads Checklist:
Paid Ads Part II Conclusion
Paid ads are the fastest way to scale how many leads you get. We
spent the lion’s share of this chapter talking about efficiency.
Because once you understand how ads really make money, it
becomes much easier to win. I’ve been very successful with paid
ads, but it wasn’t because I was the most creative or had the best
copy. It was because I knew the numbers. So follow the steps
outlined.
I recommend doing paid ads last for two reasons. First, skills from
the other three methods transfer to this one. And second, paid ads
cost money. Money you will have if you start with the other three
methods first. So learn the skills and make the money from the
other three methods, so you have the shortest learning curve on this
one.
And once we have all that, we scale it. We expect to lose more
times than we win. And once we win, we scale the hell out of it.
And that’s how we do it.
Paid ads is the last of the core four ways a single person can let
other people know about their stuff. But before we transition to the
second half of the book, I wanna show you how to put these
strategies on steroids.
Core Four On Steroids: More Better New
“If at first you don’t succeed, use force.”
I surveyed the fifty or so faces of the group. All entrepreneurs
looking to scale their businesses. Each hungry for the “missing
link” that would flood them with engaged leads. After finishing a
presentation on lead generation, I opened up the floor for Q&A:
The first business owner chimed in, “I just feel like I’ve saturated
the market. I don't think we can get any bigger in the chiropractor
niche than we already are.”
“What’re you doing in revenue?” I asked.
“$2,000,000 a year”
“And how much do you spend on advertising?”
“About $30,000 a month on Facebook”
“What’s your conversion rate from click to close?”
“I don’t know”
“So you don’t track overall throughput?”
“I guess not.”
“Okay…What other platforms do you advertise on?”
“None.”
“How much content do you make for chiropractors?”
“None.”
“How much cold outreach do you do?”
“None.”
“And the $30k you spend, on one platform, for a two million dollar
business, saturated the $15.1B chiropractor industry? Does that
sound reasonable?”
A second business owner chimed in before he could answer "If it
helps - I'm in the chiropractor niche too, and I spent $30k in
advertising, across four platforms, last week..."
“Do you still feel like you’ve saturated your niche?” I asked.
He got the point.
***
I have this conversation daily with entrepreneurs looking to grow.
Typically, they have figured out how to get enough customers from
one platform to get them to $1M-$3M per year. It’s still not
completely predictable. And they have their ups and downs. But
they have the “gist” of what they need to do and have seen some
success. So it’s at this point they hit a wall because they think they
can't make more money. They assume they’ve “tapped” their
market. I kid you not. I had a conversation with a different
entrepreneur making about $3,000,000 per year in the weight loss
space. He worried increasing his ad spend past $40,000 per month
would saturate his ad platform. For context, that platform has over
1B active daily users. And he was selling weight loss… in
America… a $60B industry. Silly.
There are more leads out there than you can possibly imagine. I’ve
used a framework to unlock those leads over and over again and
now you can use it too.
How To Get Even More Leads: More Better New
First, you reach out to people who know you. Then, you start
making free content. Then you start reaching out to people who
don’t know you. Then you start running paid ads. This is how you
do the core four to get engaged leads. And there’s really nothing
else a single person can do on their own to get them.
But what if you are doing the core four and still not getting as
many engaged leads as you want? Well, worry not! There are two
ways to boost any of the core four to get even more engaged leads
on your own. I use these every time I want to increase the engaged
lead flow in a portfolio company. They are easy to remember:
More, Better, New.
Simply stated:
1) You can do more of what you’re currently doing.
2) You can do what you’re currently doing better.
3) You can do it somewhere new.
And, just like the story in the beginning with the agency owner,
that's exactly what I was asking him. Could you advertise more?
Could you advertise better? Could you advertise somewhere new?
So let’s start with the one I actually do first: More.
More
You’ve done some advertising by now. And you know the
advertising that you do works to some degree. So the next obvious
thing you can do to get more engaged leads is - more. A lot more.
Crank up the volume to your max capacity.
Even with no improvements at all, if you double your inputs,
you’ll get more engaged leads. Make twice the reach outs, post
twice the content, run twice the ads, double the ad spend, etc. You
won’t regret it. Unless, of course, you hate money.
So while we’ll always focus on testing to make ourselves better,
which we’ll get to in a moment, the biggest increases often come
from advertising more.
Here’s how I do more: The Rule of 100
The rule of 100 is simple. You advertise your stuff by doing 100
primary actions every day, for one hundred days in a row. That’s it.
I don't make many promises, but this is one. If you do 100 primary
actions per day, and you do it for 100 days straight, you will get
more engaged leads. Commit to the rule of 100 and you will never
go hungry again.
Here’s what it looks like applied to each of the core four:
Warm Reach Outs:
100 reach outs per day
Example primary actions: email, text, direct message, calls, etc.
Post Content:
100 minutes per day making content.
Release at least one per day on a platform. As you get better, post
even more.
Example primary actions: short and long videos or articles,
podcasts, infographics, etc.
Cold Reach Outs:
100 reach outs per day
Example primary actions: email, text, direct message, cold call,
flyers, etc.
As with all cold advertising, expect lower response rates, so use
automation.
Paid Ads:
100 minutes per day making paid ads
Example primary actions: direct response media ads, direct mail,
seminar, podcast spots, etc.
100 days straight of running those paid ads. Use the daily budget
we calculated together in the paid ads chapter. Aim for Client
Financed Acquisition.
Here’s some inspiration from someone in #Mozination following
the rule of 100:
Better
Getting better gets you more leads for the same effort. We want
that. And you can only get better by doing one thing–testing. So
you do more and more… until it breaks. Then, you make it better.
In other words, if you do more for long enough, your CAC will
eventually get too high to sustain. So you make a tweak and see if
it improves. If it does, keep doing it. If it doesn’t, toss it out.
Thousands of these tiny tests separate the winners from the
beginners.
Every action a lead takes before they become a customer is a
potential “drop-off” point. So I do the most testing at whatever step
the most leads drop off. I call these “constraints.” Constraints are
the points where the smallest improvements create the biggest
boost in results. That's why they're so important. We get the
biggest bang for our buck. For example, if you have three steps in
your process:
30% Optin (give you their contact information)
5% Apply ← This is the constraint because it has the biggest dropoff
50% Schedule
But let’s ignore the constraint for a moment. Imagine we improve
each step by 5% by itself.
30 + 5%→35% Optin = 16% Increase in leads (1.16x)
5 + 5%→10% Apply = 100% Increase in leads (2x)
50 + 5%→55% Schedule = 10% Increase in leads (1.1x)
We get wildly different results! Improving the constraint also
comes out the clear winner. So, focus on the constraint. And,
again, if you’re not sure which step is the biggest constraint, find
the step where the most leads drop off. You’ll get the biggest
reward for the smallest improvement.
Here’s how I get better: I test one thing per week per platform. And
I do it for four big reasons.
1) If you test multiple things at a time on one platform you never
really learn what worked.
2) Steps affect each other. A single change can affect results at
other steps. For example, if you change step one, and more
people optin, but fewer people apply, no bueno. But you
wouldn’t know that if you changed both steps. If you make one
change you can see what happened. If you make a bunch of
changes…good luck trying to figure out what worked (or
didn’t).
3) It forces you to prioritize what will get you the most engaged
leads. You can do an infinite amount of tests. But, time is
limited. So you must choose your tests wisely. For example, if
you only do one “big” test per week per platform, don’t waste it
on a color change from red to bright red.
4) Maybe the most important, you run the test for long enough to
see if you actually get an improvement. Too short and you won’t
get enough data. Too long and you waste time you could’ve
spent improving the next constraint. With the size of my team
and the amount of money I spend on advertising, one week is
typically long enough for me.
In every company I own, I set up a testing schedule. Every
Monday we run one split test per platform. We give it a week. And
the next Monday, we do three things:
1) Look at the results, and pick the winners for each platform test.
2) Then (important), we write down the results of the test in a log
of all tests. So the next time we do something, we start a zillion
improvements later, not at square one.
3) Come up with our next test to beat our current ‘best’ version. If
we can’t beat the version we’re currently running in four tries
(or one month), we move onto the next constraint.
You continue to allocate effort to make things better. But, at a
certain point, the effort you put into making it better brings lower
and lower returns. At some point, it makes more sense to invest
your effort into something that will bring higher returns. Only at
this point, do we try something new.
New
So after you’ve improved your marketing efforts through ‘more’
and ‘better’ the only thing you have left is - ‘new places in new
ways.’ In simple terms–new. And if you think your business can’t
possibly get any bigger, let me show you why it can. Then, I’ll
show you how it can.
Most business owners look only at the platform and tiny
community they market in. And usually, there are only three or
four big companies marketing in their niche. So, they assume those
companies must split the entire market between them. This is
exactly what the entrepreneur in my intro story did. Think for a
moment about how ridiculous this is. I call this problem: The Size
Of The Pie Fallacy. Here’s a drawing to illustrate how the market
is, in fact, much bigger than most assume.
The Size Of The Pie Fallacy. A small business uses one of the
core four, on one platform, in one specific way, with a very
targeted audience. And in that same space, advertising the same
way, there may only be a handful of other competitors.
They mistakenly assume the tiny slice of the universe they
advertise to is the entire available market! This is why most
businesses stay small. When they plateau, they think there’s no
more leads to get. They believe they got as big as they possibly
can. Because, for many, saying "I'm as big as I can get" is much
easier than saying "I’m not as good at advertising as I thought.”
This false argument keeps entrepreneurs everywhere poorer than
they should be.
When to do new: When the returns you get from doing
more↔better are lower than what you could get from a new
placement or new way of advertising.
There are many other slices of attention (and potential leads)
sitting just inside the tiny universe of “post content.” They could
add new placements (since many platforms have multiple places
and forms of content). For example, on Instagram you can make
stories, messenger ads, and posts. On YouTube you can make
shorts, longs, community posts, etc. Or, they could add a new
platform. They go from Instagram messenger to Facebook
messenger. They go from YouTube shorts videos to Instagram
short videos (reels). Etc. And once they’ve exhausted those, they
could add an entirely new core four activity.
And if you're curious, the order I pick my next ‘new’ comes down
to one thing: what will get me the most leads for the amount of
work? That is the rule. And nine times out of ten, it goes like this:
New placements→New Platforms→New Core Four.
Bottom Line: No matter how you advertise, you could do it in new
ways (different styles of content) or in new places (think other
platforms). Then finally, do a new core four activity altogether.
And, you guessed it, each of them gets us what we want - more
leads.
Now, this is much harder in practice, which is why I exhaust
‘more, better’ first. But at a certain point you have to expand to
‘new’ placements, platforms, and core four activities to let more
people know about your stuff.
Action Step: Exhaust more better first. Once you can’t do
anymore, any better (meaning the returns are lower than putting
that same effort into a new platform) try new. Use this rough order:
new placement, new platform, new core four activity. Get it going.
Measure how you do. And scale up from there using more–better.
Then, rinse and repeat.
‘More Better New’ Summary
First, you do way more of the advertising that works until it
“breaks.” Then, the next drop off point becomes obvious. Then you
keep that level of advertising up while you go back, fix the
constraint, and make it better. So really, better and more work with
each other more than they work separately. The first question I
usually ask myself before we invest in a company that needs to get
more customers is “What’s stopping them from doing ten times
what they’re currently doing?” Sometimes, nothing– so we just do
more. Other times we just need to make something better first. So
answer that question and you’ll know what to do next.
Only once you’ve exhausted more–better do the real returns come
from doing new. First, go with new ad placements on a platform
you know. Second, go with placements you know on a new
platform. Then, once you get the hang of that new platform, use
new placements on it. Once you exhaust that, you can add a new
core four activity on top of what you currently do. That gives you
my simple, real-world way, I put the core four on steroids to get
even more leads.
Conclusion
Advertising is the process of making known. It’s what we do to let
strangers know about the stuff we sell. Now, we solved ‘the stuff’
problem with your lead magnet or offer. But to get them to turn
into engaged leads, you have to tell them about it. So we spent this
section going over the only four ways a single person can
advertise–let other people know about their stuff. And to do it, you
trade either time, money, or both. And when you do it, you can
advertise to people who know you (warm) or you can advertise to
strangers (cold). You can advertise publicly (content/ads) or
privately (outreach).
As far as what to do when? Whenever I build a business I think
about it this way–after I do warm outreach to get my pool of
customers going–if I have more time than money, I move to
posting content. If I have more money than time, I go with cold
outreach or running ads.
But remember, you only need to do one to get engaged leads. So,
just pick one. Then, max it out. Do more. Do better. Do new. And,
all the advertising methods compound together. The money,
systems, and experience you earned from the prior method will
help you master the next. A business that posts free content and
runs paid ads will get more out of their ads and their content than a
business that does only one or the other. A business that does cold
outreach and makes content will get more from their cold outreach
and work their warm leads better than one that does only one.
Every combination of the core four advertising activities boost
each other in some way.
And as a personal note, I’ve done ‘em all. I built my first
business off posting content and warm outreach. I built my gyms
off free content and paid ads. I built Gym Launch off paid ads and
cold outreach. I built Prestige Labs off affiliates (which we cover
in Section IV). I built ALAN off paid ads and affiliates (also
Section IV). I built Acquisition.com off posting content. There are
many ways to get engaged leads. If you master one, you will be
able to feed yourself for the rest of your life. They all work if you
do.
Next Up
If you follow the steps in this book, you’ll run out of hours in the
day. You won’t be able to do any more, any better… let alone add
anything new! So you’ll need help on your journey to the land of
endless leads. You’ll need allies. Those allies come in four
different flavors. And since there are more of them than there are
of you, they’re the key to getting there. So let’s go get them.
