VALUE OFFER: THE VALUE EQUATION
“We question all of our beliefs, except for the ones we really believe in, and those we never think to question.”
ORSON SCOTT CARD
want to be abundantly clear: the goal should be to charge as much money for your products or services as humanly
possible. I'm talking heinous amounts of money. That being said, anyone can raise their prices, but only a select few can
charge these rates and get people to say yes.
From this point forward, you must abandon any notion you have about “what's fair.” Every enormous company in the world
charges you money for things that cost them nothing. It costs pennies for the phone company to add an additional user, except
they don’t mind charging you hundreds per month for access. It costs pennies to manufacture pharmaceutical drugs, but they
don’t mind charging hundreds of dollars a month for it. Media companies charge advertisers a king’s ransom for your eyeballs,
and it costs them next to nothing to get you to like kitten photos on social media. You need to have a big discrepancy between
what something costs you and what you charge for it. It is the only way to be unreasonably successful.
Many entrepreneurs believe that charging “too much” is bad. The reality is that, yes, you should never charge more than
your product is worth. But you should charge far more for your product and services than it costs to fulfill it. Think up to a
hundred times more, not just two or three times more. And if you provide enough value, it should still always be a steal for the
prospect. That is the power of value. It unleashes unlimited pricing and profit power to scale your company.
For example, one of my private clients (whose company I have equity in) is in the photography space. Over two years,
implementing the tactics outlined in this book, the owner was able to increase the average ticket from $300 to $1,500. That’s a
5x increase (gasp). Even cooler, they now spend less time per customer, and have higher customer satisfaction. The 5x
increase in average ticket, 38x’d the profit of the business. It went from making $1,000/wk in profit to $38,000/wk in profit,
and continues to grow. As a result, the company was finally able to continue to scale to multiple locations and provide
meaningful work to great employees. And a fun benefit, we were able to donate even more money to children’s charities which
is something the owner and I have in common (almost $500,000 at the time of this writing). But none of that would have been
possible without figuring out what people valued most, tripling down on it, and ruthlessly eliminating everything else. A 5x
price increase may seem crazy to you, but clients voted with their dollars that what the company provides now is far better
than what it did before. Cracking value opens up the world of unlimited profit, impact and possibilities.
Those who understand value are the ones who will be able to charge the most money for their services. The good news is
that there is a repeatable formula that I have created (I’ve never seen it displayed elsewhere) to help quantify the variables that
create value for any offer. I call it The Value Equation. Once you see it, you can never unsee it. It will operate in your
subconscious, running in the background, calling out to you. It’s a new lens through which to see the world.
The Value Equation
FREE GIFT #4: Value Equation Bonus Tutorial & Free Download(s):
If you want to know how I break down a businesses core offering into something more valuable go to acquisition.com/offers and select the “Value
Equation” video to watch a short tutorial. I also included a downloadable checklist. My goal is to gain your trust and deliver value in advance. As such,
it’s absolutely free. Enjoy.
As you can see from the picture, there are four primary drivers of value. Two of the drivers (on top), you will seek to
increase. The other two (on the bottom), you will seek to decrease.
1. (Yay) The Dream Outcome (Goal: Increase)
2. (Yay) Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (Goal: Increase)
3. (Boo) Perceived Time Delay Between Start and Achievement (Goal: Decrease)
4. (Boo) Perceived Effort & Sacrifice (Goal: Decrease)
If you noticed the questions in the last section that my father asked me, you’ll see they corresponded with these pillars:
What will I make? (Dream Outcome)
How will I know it's going to happen? (Perceived Likelihood of Achievement)
How long will it take? (Time Delay)
What is expected of me? (Effort & Sacrifice)
Get The Bottom To Zero
In the beginning of my career, I focused all my attention on dream outcomes and the perception of achievement (social
proof, third-party edification, etc). In other words, the top side of the equation. That’s where beginner marketers make bigger
and bigger claims. It’s easy, and it’s lazy.
But as time has gone on, I have realized that these larger-than-life claims are the easiest to establish (and therefore less
unique). After all, anyone can make a promise. The harder, and more competitive, are the Time Delay and Effort & Sacrifice.
The best companies in the world focus all their attention on the bottom side of the equation. Making things immediate,
seamless, and effortless. Apple made the iPhone effortless compared to other phones at the time. Amazon made purchasing a
single click of a button and made purchases arrive almost immediately (maybe by the time you read this, they’ll be sending
drones to our doors within 60 minutes). Netflix made consuming television immediate and effortless. So, the older I get, the
more I have shifted my focus to “the hard stuff” — decreasing the bottom side of the equation. And I believe the better you do
this, the more you will be rewarded by the marketplace.
Final note: The reason this is a division equation and not an addition (“+”) is that I wanted to convey one key point. If you
can make the bottom part of the equation equal to zero, you’re golden. No matter how small the top side is, anything divided by
zero equals infinity (which is technically undefined for the math nerds). In other words, if you can reduce your prospects' true
time delay to receiving value to zero (aka you realize your immediate dream outcome), and your effort and sacrifice is zero,
you have an infinitely valuable product. If you accomplish this, you win the game.
Given this postulate, a prospect would (in theory) purchase something from you, and the moment their credit card was run,
it would immediately become their reality. That is infinite value.
Imagine clicking the purchase button on a weight loss product and instantly seeing your stomach turn into a six-pack. Or
imagine hiring a marketing firm, and as soon as you sign your document, your phone begins ringing with new highly qualified
prospects. How valuable would these products/services be? Infinitely valuable. And that’s the point.
I don't know if we entrepreneurs will ever get there, but that is the hypothetical limit we all should strive towards, and why
I structured the equation this way.
Perception is Reality
Perception is reality. It’s not about how much you increase your prospect’s likelihood of success, or decrease the time
delay to achievement, or decrease their effort and sacrifice. That in itself is not valuable. Many times, they will have no idea.
The Grand Slam Offer only becomes valuable once the prospect perceives the increase in likelihood of achievement, perceives
the decrease in time delay, and perceives the decrease in effort and sacrifice.
A prime example of this happened in the London tunnel system. The biggest increase in rider satisfaction (aka value) was
never from faster trains to decrease wait times. Instead, it was from a simple dotted map that showed them when the next train
was coming and how long they had to wait. The dotted map, which only cost a few million dollars, decreased the riders’
perception of time delay and sacrifice (being bored waiting) more than actually making the trains faster (which costs billions
of dollars to do). Isn’t that cool? This is how we need to think about our products.
Pro Tip: Logical vs Psychological Solutions
Most people naturally try and solve problems using logical solutions. But the logical solutions have usually been tried...because they’re logical (it’s what
everyone would try and do).
As a business owners and entrepreneurs I increasingly approach problems to find psychological solutions, rather than logical ones. Because if there were
a logical solution, it probably would have already been solved, thereby eliminating the problem. All that’s left are the psychological problems.
Examples inspired by Rory Sutherland, CMO of Ogilvy Advertising:
“Any fool can sell a product by offering it for a discount, it takes great marketing to sell the same product for a premium”
Logical solution: make trains faster to increase satisfaction
Psychological solution: decrease the pain of waiting by adding a dotted map
Psychological solution: pay models to be the hostesses on the trip (people would wish it took longer to get to their destination!)
Logical solution: make elevator faster
Psychological solution: add floor to ceiling mirrors so people are distracted staring at themselves and forget how long they were on the elevator
Logical solution: make it cheaper
Psychological solution: make fewer of them and raise the price which causes people to want it more.
Often, most logical solutions have been tried and failed. At this point in history, we must give the psychological solutions a shot to solve problems.
As such, as business owners, it is up to us to communicate these value drivers with clarity to increase the prospect’s
perception of these realities. The extent to which you answer these questions in the mind of your prospect will determine the
value you are creating. Only then, will we truly be able to realize the actual value of our product to the marketplace, and by
extension, the egregious prices we want to charge.
It’s difficult to separate the four value drivers from another, as most vehicles combine many of these elements together, but I
will do my best to isolate and clearly explain each below.
#1 Dream Outcome (Goal = Increase)
People have deep, unchanging desires. This is what marriages are lost over, wars are fought over, and people will
willingly die for. Our goal is not to create desire. It’s simply to channel that desire through our offer and monetization vehicle.
The dream outcome is the expression of the feelings and experiences the prospect has envisioned in their mind. It’s the gap
between their current reality and their dreams. Our goal is to accurately depict that dream back to them, so they feel
understood, and explain how our vehicle will get them there.
The dream outcome is simple; it’s the “getting there” where the value gets enhanced or detracted.
People generally, and our clients specifically, want:
. . . To be perceived as beautiful
. . . To be respected
. . . To be perceived as powerful
. . . To be loved
. . . To increase their status
These are all powerful drivers.
But multiple vehicles may accomplish the same thing. Take the desire “to be perceived as beautiful” for example, here are
a lot of things that touch on this desire:
Make Up
Anti-aging creams/serums
Supplements
Shapewear
Plastic Surgery
Fitness
→ All these vehicles channel the desire to be perceived as beautiful.
And if we further unpack the idea of a desire to be beautiful, we see that it may be a surface-level declaration of a deeper
desire to achieve higher status in one’s social group.
The dream outcome value driver is most prominently used when comparing the relative value between two different
desires being satisfied. In general, the dream outcome that most directly increases a prospect’s status will be the one they
value most. As such, a prospect may value that entire category of vehicles that satisfy one desire more than another category
that satisfies a different desire. For many men, making money is more important than being handsome. Why? Because money
drives status for men more than being handsome does. So, in general, they will value all offers that make them money more than
offers that help them look good.
I once heard Russell Brunson tell a story about this concept. He explained how his wife, Collette, at first hearing about this
status concept, rejected it. She claimed she wasn’t driven by status and would never want to drive a Lamborghini. Instead, she
favored her minivan. But, after talking further, she revealed it was because driving a Lamborghini would decrease her status
amongst her mom friends, while driving a minivan would show she was a good mother (increase in status). So it’s not about the
money, it's about the status (the perceived increase or decrease in relative standing when compared to others socially or
professionally). Talk in terms of things your prospect believes will increase their status, and you will have your prospects
drooling.
Pro Tip: Frame benefits in terms of status gained from the viewpoint of others
When writing copy, you can make it that much more powerful by talking about how other people will perceive the prospect’s achievement. Connect
the dots for them. Example: If you buy this golf club, your drive will increase by 40 yards. Your golf buddies' jaws will drop when they see your ball soar 40
yards past theirs . . . they’ll ask you what’s changed . . . only you will know.
That being said, when comparing two products or services that satisfy the same desire, the value from the dream outcomes
will cancel out (since they are the same). It will be the other three variables that drive the difference in perceived value, and
ultimately price. For example, if we have two products or services that both help make someone beautiful, it will be the
likelihood of achievement, time delay, and effort required that will differentiate the perceived value of each offer.
Simply put: if two things make someone beautiful, what makes one worth $50,000 and another $5? Answer: The extent of
the other three value variables.
#2 Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (Goal = Increase)
This was the last of the variables I added when trying to think through this framework a few years ago. I just felt like
something was missing with only the other three.
Then I realized people pay for certainty. They value certainty. I call this “the perceived likelihood of achievement.” In
other words, “How likely do I believe it is that I will achieve the result I am looking for if I make this purchase?”
For example, how much would you pay to be a plastic surgeon’s 10,000th patient versus their first?
If you're a normal, sane person, a lot more. I mean heck, you might even ask them to pay you if you are their first patient
ever.
So you can see even from this simple example that while the service you are receiving is technically the same, the only
thing that changes is your perceived likelihood of getting what you want.
Both surgeons take the same amount of time to do the surgery (if anything, the guy who has done it 10,000 times would
likely get it done faster and still charge more). The more-experienced surgeon has a track record of achieving a result, which
incentivizes their desirability.
People value this perceived likelihood of achievement. Increasing a prospect’s conviction that your offer will “actually”
work for them, will make your offer that much more valuable even though the work remains the same on your end. So to
increase value with all offers, we must communicate perceived likelihood of achievement through our messaging, proof, what
we choose to include or exclude in our offer, and our guarantees (more on these later).
#3 Time Delay (Goal = Decrease)
Time delay is the time between a client buying and receiving the promised benefit. The shorter the distance between when
they purchase and they receive value/the outcome, the more valuable your services or product is.
There are two elements to this driver of value: Long-term outcome and short-term experience. Many times, there are shortterm
experiences that occur while en route to the long-term outcomes. They happen “along the way” and provide value.
It’s good to understand both. The thing people buy is the long-term value, aka their “dream outcome.” But the thing that
makes them stay long enough to get it is the short-term experience. These are little milestones a prospect sees along the way
that shows them they are on the right path. We try and tie as many of these as possible into any service we offer. We want
clients to have a big emotional win early (as close as possible to their purchase). This gives them the emotional buy in and the
momentum to “see it through” to their ultimate goal.
For example, it takes a while to add an extra $239,000 per year to a gym. But that’s what they’re buying. So, once they have
purchased, we need to create emotional wins fast. One way we do this is to get their ads live and get them to close their first
$2,000 sale within their first seven days. By doing this, their decision to work with us is reinforced, and they immediately trust
us more. This makes them more likely to follow the rest of our systems and get to their ultimate destination.
Pro Tip: Fast Wins
Always try and incorporate short-term, immediate wins for a client. Be creative. They just need to know they are on the right path and that they made
the right decision trusting you and your business.
Let me give you another example. If I sell someone a bikini body, their time delay to realize that outcome may be 12 months
or even longer. Along the way, though, as they change their bodies, they may experience higher sex drive, more energy, and an
increased community of friends.
They aren’t initially buying those things, but those things may become short-term benefits that keep them in the game long
enough to achieve their ultimate outcome. They buy the dream, but they stay for the benefits they discover along the way. The
faster and more clearly you can demonstrate those benefits, the more valuable your service will be. For a weight loss customer,
we would get them to meet someone else so they immediately had some social benefits from the program, and we usually gave
them a more aggressive diet in the beginning. Why? Because we wanted them to have a big, fast emotional win, so we could
get them to commit to the long term. This is also backed by science. People who experience a victory early on are more likely
to continue with something than those who do not.
That being said, having to wait 12 to 24 months to get what you want is a long time when you can do liposuction and be
done in an afternoon. This shows just one of the reasons people pay $25,000 for liposuction with a tummy tuck, while people
will barely pay $100/mo to join a bootcamp.
But that’s not the only reason, is it?
That leads me to the last driver of value - effort and sacrifice.
Pro Tip: Fast Beats Free
The only thing that beats “free” is “fast.” People will pay for speed. Many companies have entered free spaces and done exceedingly well with a
“speed first” strategy. A few notable examples: The MVD vs DMV wait in line forever or pay $50 you can skip the line and get your license renewed
privately. Fedex vs USPS (when it absolutely positively has to be there overnight). Spotify vs Slow Free Music. Uber vs Walking. Fast beats free. Many
will always be willing to pay (price) for the (value) of speed. So if you find yourself in a market competing against free, double down on speed.
#4 Effort & Sacrifice (Goal = Decrease)
This is what it “costs” people in ancillary costs, aka “other costs accrued along the way.” These can be both tangible and
intangible.
Using the fitness versus liposuction example, let’s look at the difference in effort and sacrifice:
Massive difference, right?
In fact, in looking at the marketing of plastic surgeons, these are the exact pain points they hit on when they say things like:
“Tired of wasting countless hours in the gym. . . . tired of trying diets that just don't work?”
This is why when you sell fitness, you have to spend an hour arm-wrestling a client to give over 1/10th to 1/100th of the
amount of money they pay for surgery. There's just not a lot of perceived value because the perceived likelihood of
achievement, the time delay to achievement, and the effort and sacrifice are so high.
So even though the outcome is the same, the value of the vehicles are dramatically different, hence the difference in price.
Decreasing the effort and sacrifice, or at least the perceived effort and sacrifice, can massively boost the appeal of your
offer.
In an ideal world, a prospect would want to simply “say yes” and have their dream outcome happen with no more effort on
their behalf.
This is why “done for you services” are almost always more expensive than “do-it-yourself” because the person doesn't
have all the effort and sacrifice. There is also a component of “perceived likelihood of achievement” difference as well.
People believe that if an expert does it, then they will be more likely to achieve the outcome than if they try on their own.
My hope is that you now have a foundational understanding of the components of value and how the interplay between each
of the components creates or detracts from the value someone might be willing to pay.
Putting It All Together
As I said earlier, these elements of value don’t happen in a vacuum. They happen together, in combination. So let’s look at
a few examples that utilize all four components of value at once.
In an effort to quantify the value, I’ll rate them on a binary scale of 0 or 1. 1 being value achieved. 0 being missing. Then I
will add all four together to give you a relative value rating of a type of service. Our goal as marketers and business owners is
to increase the value of the dream outcome and its perceived likelihood of achievement, while decreasing the time delay of
achievement and the effort and sacrifice one has to put in to get there.
To start I will do a side by side comparison of two “vehicles” with identical Dream outcomes: Meditation and Xanax. Both
offer the buyer relaxation, decreased anxiety, and feelings of well-being. I will demonstrate how the other three variables
dramatically shift the value of delivering that dream outcome and ultimately, the price.
Example: Dream Outcome: “Relaxation,” “Decreased Anxiety,” “Feelings of well-being” Meditation vs Xanax
And that is why Xanax is a multi-billion dollar product while I know of almost no multi-billion dollar meditation
businesses . . . value.
I'm not here to argue about whether meditation is better than Xanax (obviously it is) but that doesn't mean it’s perceived as
more valuable.
This is also the reason that the supplement industry ($123B, Grandview Research) is twice the size of the health club
industry ($62B, IHRSA). They both accomplish the same perceived objectives — “being healthy,” “losing weight,” “looking
good,” “increased energy,” etc. — but one is perceived as more valuable because it has lower “costs.”
People are more willing to pay $200 for supplements than they are a $29/mo membership. Taking a pill, or drinking a
shake, is so much faster and easier than going to the gym everyday. Hence . . . valued.
Crazy world we live in.
And you can either sit there and make “complain” posts about how people “ought” to be a certain way. Or you can take
advantage of the way people are and capitalize. This book is for those people who want to be victors, not victims of
circumstances.
You can either be right or you can be rich. This book is for getting rich. If that bothers you, just put this down and go back to
arguing against human nature. Hint: You’re not gonna change it.
Now, that being said, knowing what people value versus what is good for them is key. It means you can find ways to
monetize the things that people value in order to give them what they really need.
Win-win.
You can make your dent in the universe while making a profit.

VALUE OFFER: THE THOUGHT PROCESS
“If at first you don't succeed, try, try, try again.”
THOMAS H. PALMER, TEACHER’S MANUAL
want to do an exercise with you right now. I want to show you the difference between convergent and divergent problem
solving. Why? So that you can actually create the Grand Slam Offer that will become the cornerstones of your business.
Convergent & Divergent Thinking
In simple terms, convergent problem solving is where you take lots of variables, all known, with unchanging conditions and
converge on a singular answer. Think math.
Example:
You have 3 salespeople who can each take 100 calls per month each.
It takes 4 calls to create one sale (including no shows).
You need to get to 110 sales . . .
How many sales people must you hire?
Deduced Information:
1 salesperson = 100 calls
4 calls = 1 close
100 calls/4 calls per close = 25 Closes Per 100 Calls
25 closes per rep
Goal: 110 sales total / 25 sales per rep = 4.4
Since you can't hire 4.4 reps, you decide you must have five.
ANSWER: And since you have 3, you hire two more.
Math problems are convergent. There are lots of variables and a single answer. We are taught all our lives in school to
think this way. That is because it’s easy to grade.
But life will pay you for your ability to solve using a divergent thought process. In other words, think of many solutions to a
single problem. Not only that, convergent answers are binary. They are either right or they are wrong. With divergent thinking,
you can have multiple right answers, and one answer that is way more right than the others. Cool right?
Here’s what life presents us for divergent thinking: Multiple Variables, Known & Unknown, Dynamic Conditions, Multiple
Answers.
As such, I want to do an exercise with you that will engage the part of your brain that you will need to use in order to make
something magical.
I call it the “brick” exercise. Don’t worry, it’ll only take 120 seconds.
The Brick Exercise
Right now, I want you to set a timer on your phone for 120 seconds. What you need to do: Think of a brick.
Write down as many different uses of a brick as you can possibly think of. How many different ways could a brick be used
in life to provide value.
Ready? Go. It’s okay to write in the book.

Alright — stop. Now before I show you my list, did you consider the following . . .
. . . How big is the brick? A tab of gum, 3-5/8" x 2-1/4" x 8" (Standard), 2 ft x 2 ft x 6ft?
. . . What is the brick made of? Plastic, Gold, Clay, Wood, Metal?
. . . How is the brick shaped? Does it have holes in it? Does it have divots for interlocking?
Now as you think about that, can you think of even more uses for the brick than you probably wrote down?
Here’s my list:
Paper weight
Door stop
Building things
Home for a fish in a fish bowl
Plant holder with dirt in the holes (holed brick)
As a trophy (painted brick)
Rustic decoration
To break window
Make a mural (tiny bricks painted)
A weight for resistance training
A wedge under uneven platform
Pen holder (holed brick)
Children’s toy (lego bricks)
Floatation device (plastic brick)
Payment for goods (gold brick)
Stabilizer for leaning something against
Retainer of value (gold brick)
Holder for flagpole (holed brick)
A seat (jumbo brick)
Every offer has building blocks, the pieces that when combined make an offer irresistible. Our goal is to use a divergent
thought process to think of as many easy ways to combine these elements to provide value.
So if I were selling a brick, I would find out what my customer’s desire was, and then devise how many ways I could
create value with my “brick.”
Now let’s do it for real.

VALUE OFFER: CREATING YOUR GRAND SLAM OFFER PART I: PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS
“ABC, Easy as 123 Ah, simple as doh reh mi”
MICHAEL JACKSON, “ABC”
hen I started my gym, I struggled. I wanted so deeply to be successful, prove my dad wrong about my decision to start
my own business, and prove to myself that I was worth something. But try as I did, I couldn't even sell people into a
$99/mo bootcamp. People would say, “LA Fitness is $29/mo. This is expensive.” I even tried getting people to start for free.
They said they wouldn't bother because $99/mo afterwards was still too much, and they didn't want to start something they
wouldn't continue with.
It’s a new level of frustration when you can’t even give your services away for free to people. I felt worthless, and I didn't
know what to do. Thankfully, during this time, I was in groups with other gym owners, and I started hearing about marketers
and books. I devoured everything I could. And as soon as I stumbled on Dan Kennedy’s books, I was hooked.
In his books, he talked about making “irresistible offers.” Again, this theme of “making an offer so good people would feel
stupid to say no” kept re-appearing. But this time, remembering what TJ had told me, I decided to go all in on this concept,
rather than just do what everyone else was doing.
But how? Everyone else was selling $99/mo bootcamps. How was I going to compete? So I decided to look at what we
did differently. I thought — what do they really want? No one wants a membership; they want to lose weight.
Step #1: Identify Dream Outcome
I had heard of weight loss challenges, so I started there.
Lose 20lbs in 6 weeks.
Big dream outcome - lose 20lbs.
With a decreased time delay - 6 weeks.
Note: I wasn't selling my membership anymore. I wasn’t selling the plane flight. I was selling the vacation. When you are
thinking about your dream outcome, it has to be them arriving at their destination and what they would like to experience.
Step #2: List Problems
Next, I wrote down all the things people struggled with and their limiting thoughts around them. When listing out problems,
think about what happens immediately before and immediately after someone uses your product/service. What's the “next” thing
they need help with? These are all the problems. Think about it in insane detail. If you do, you will create a more valuable and
compelling offer as you’ll continually be answering people’s next problem as it manifests..
So, let’s go ahead and list out the problems from a prospect’s perspective as you think about them. What points of friction
exist for them? I like to think in the sequence that the customer will experience each of these obstacles. Again, channel insane
detail (the more problems the better!).
Example Problem List: Weight Loss
First thing they must do: Buying healthy food, grocery shopping
1. Buying healthy food is hard, confusing, and I won’t like it
2. Buying healthy food will take too much time
3. Buying healthy food is expensive
4. I will not be able to cook healthy food forever. My family’s needs will get in my way. If I travel I won’t know what
to get.
Next thing they must do: Cooking healthy food
1. Cooking healthy food is hard and confusing. I won’t like it, and I will suck at it.
2. Cooking healthy food will take too much time
3. Cooking healthy food is expensive. It’s not worth it.
4. I will not be able to buy healthy food forever. My family’s needs will get in my way. If I travel I won’t know how to
cook healthy.
Next thing they must do: Eating healthy food
1) Etc...
Next thing they must do: Exercise Regularly
1) Etc...
Now we’re gonna go full circle here. Each of the above problems has four negative elements. And you guessed it, each
aligns with the four value drivers as well.
1. Dream Outcome→ This will not be financially worth it
2. Likelihood of Achievement→ It won’t work for me specifically. I won't be able to stick with it. External factors
will get in my way. (This is the most unique and service-specific of the problem buckets).
3. Effort & Sacrifice→ This will be too hard, confusing. I won’t like it. I will suck at it.
4. Time→ This will take too much time to do. I am too busy to do this. It will take too long to work. It won’t be
convenient for me.
Now, go ahead and list out all the problems your prospect has. Don’t let these buckets, which are just meant to get your
brain going, constrain you. If it’s easier for you, just list out everything you can possibly think of.
What I showed here isn’t just four problems, though. We have 16 core problems with two to four sub problems underneath.
So 32 to 64 problems total. Yowza. No wonder most people don't achieve their goals. Do not get overwhelmed. This is the
best news ever. The more problems you think of, the more problems you get to solve.
So, to recap, just list out each core thing that someone has to do. Then think of all the reasons they wouldn't be able to do it,
or keep doing it (using the four value drivers as a guide).
Now we get to the fun part: turning problems into solutions.
Step #3: Solutions List
Now that we have our dream outcome and all the obstacles that will get in someone’s way, it’s time to define our solutions
and list them out.
Creating the solutions list has two steps. First, we are going to first transform our problems into solutions. Second, we are
going to name these solutions. That’s it. So let’s take a look at our list of problems from earlier. What we’re going to do is
simply turn them into solutions by thinking, “What would I need to show someone to solve this problem?” Then we are going
to reverse each element of the obstacle into solution-oriented language. This is copywriting 101. It’s beyond the scope of this
book to get into, but simply adding “how to” then reversing the problem will give most people new to this process a great
place to start. For our purposes, we are giving ourselves a checklist of exactly what we are going to have to do for our
prospects and what we are going to solve for them.
Once we have our list of solutions, we will operationalize how we are actually going to solve these problems (create
value) in the next step. And I want to be 100 percent clear. You will solve every problem. We’ll explore how together, in the
next step.
PROBLEM→ SOLUTION
PROBLEM: Buying healthy food, grocery shopping
. . . is hard, confusing, I won’t like it. I will suck at it→ How to make buying healthy food easy and enjoyable, so that
anyone can do it (especially busy moms!)
. . . takes too much time→ How to buy healthy food quickly
. . . is expensive→ How to buy healthy food for less than your current grocery bill
. . . is unsustainable→ How to make buying healthy food take less effort than buying unhealthy food
. . . is not my priority. My family’s needs will get in my way→ How to buy healthy food for you and your family at the
same time
. . . is undoable if I travel; I won’t know what to get→ How to get healthy food when traveling
PROBLEM: Cooking healthy food
. . . is hard, confusing. I won’t like it, and I will suck at it→ How anyone can enjoy cooking healthy meals easily
. . . will take too much time→ How to cook meals in under 5 minutes
. . . is expensive, it’s not worth it→ How eating healthy is actually cheaper than unhealthy food
. . . is unsustainable → How to make eating healthy last forever
. . . is not my priority, my family’s needs will get in my way→ How to cook this despite your families concerns
. . . is undoable if I travel I won’t know how to cook healthy→ How to travel and still cook healthy
PROBLEM: Eating healthy food
. . . is hard, confusing, and I won’t like it→ How to eat delicious healthy food, without following complicated systems
. . . etc
PROBLEM: Exercise Regularly
. . . is hard, confusing, and I won’t like it, and I will suck at it → Easy to follow exercise system that everyone enjoys
….etc.
Okay, whew. That’s a lot of problems (and a lot of intuited solutions courtesy of divergent thinking). You’ll also notice that
a lot of them are repetitive. That’s totally normal. The value drivers are the four core reasons. Our problems always relate to
those drivers, and our solutions provide the needed answer to give a prospect permission to purchase. What's even crazier: is
that if only one of these needs is missing in a solution, it can cause someone not to buy. You would be amazed at the reasons
people do not buy. So don’t limit yourself here.
Brooke Castillo is a friend who runs an enormous life coaching business. To give you a different take on the problemssolutions
list, Brooke sent me her list as she was going through this book to make a Grand Slam Offer for a 90-Day
Relationship course. Take a look to see this process through a totally different lens. The main takeaway, though: Don’t be fancy.
Just get all the problems down then turn them into solutions.
Regardless of whether the offer you’re creating is around fitness (like the example), a relationship course (like Brooke), or
something wildly different (like ear aches), we now know what we need to do. Step four is the how (and how to do it without
breaking the bank).

I
VALUE OFFER: CREATING YOUR GRAND SLAM OFFER PART II: TRIM & STACK
“Cut! Cut! Cut!”
FRIENDS TO RACHEL GREEN IN FRIENDS
divided this chapter into two parts because it’s the meatiest section in the book. It’s also the most important. Without a
valuable product or service, the rest of the book won’t be as actionable. We just covered all the problems we are going to
solve. The second half of making your offer is breaking down tactically what we are going to do/provide for our client. In
theory, we’d all love to fly out and live with our customers to fix their problems. In reality, that wouldn’t make a very scalable
business. We need our offer to be incredibly attractive and profitable.
That being said, if this is your first Grand Slam Offer, it’s important to over-deliver like crazy. Maybe flying out isn’t such
a bad idea in the beginning. Make some sales, then think about how to make it easier for your clients. You want them to think to
themselves, “I get all this, for only that?” In essence, you want them to perceive tremendous value.
Everyone buys bargains. Some people just buy $100,000 things for only $10,000. That’s where we want to live: high
prices, but a steal for the value (like hopefully this book so far).
Sales to Fulfillment Continuum
In order to best absorb the notions of trimming and stacking, we need a mental reframe.
Enter the sales to fulfillment continuum.
Whenever you are building a business, you have a continuum between ease of fulfillment and ease of sales. If you lower
what you have to do, it increases how hard your product or service is to sell. If you do as much as possible, it makes your
product or service easy to sell but hard to fulfill because there’s more demand on your time investment. The trick, and the
ultimate goal, is to find a sweet spot where you sell something very well that’s also easy to fulfill.
I have always lived by the mantra, “Create flow. Monetize flow. Then add friction.” This means I generate demand first.
Then, with my offer, I get them to say yes. Once I have people saying yes, then, and only then, will I add friction in my
marketing, or decide to offer less for the same price.
Practicality drives this practice. If you can’t get demand flowing in, then you have no idea whether what you have is good.
I’d rather do more for every customer and have cash flow coming in, then optimize my business but have zero cash flow
coming in after (and zero idea about what I need to adjust to better serve my customers).
Here’s a perfect example to drive this home. When I started Gym Launch, gym owners reached out asking me to help. They
needed so much help, I didn’t know where to start. But I wanted to make sure they got way more than they paid me. So here’s
what I ended up doing to fill their gyms: I would fly out to their gym for 21 days, spend my own money on hotels, car rentals,
eating out, advertising, generate the leads, work the leads, then sell for them. I would even do the first onboarding meeting with
clients to get them started. In short, I did everything. I took on all the risk.
They only had to put down $500 to “reserve” their date, which I made refundable at the end of their launch. So they had 0
financial risk, 0 time risk, 0 effort, and the deal was, I got to keep all the up front cash collected from selling their services, and
they got clients for free. You can imagine how this was a pretty compelling offer.
On my own, I was able to sell about $100,000/mo in up front cash for myself. So these deals were very lucrative for me.
Over time, I scaled that to a team of 8 guys selling every month. But this began to wear on me and the team. It was at that point
that I realized that if I were to simply teach them how to do what I did, I could charge maybe a third of what I would normally
make, but I would be able to help hundreds of gyms a month instead of eight. And, I could do it all sleeping in my own bed
every night.
My promise was fundamentally the same: I will fill your gym in 30 days. It was simply the how and what I did that
changed. The how and what is what we are breaking apart.
When talking to business owners about their model, I tell them to create cash flow by over-delivering like crazy at first.
Then use the cash flow to fix your operations and make your business more efficient. This revision process can be pretty
seamless. You may not even have to change what you offer. You may just end up creating systems that create the same value for
the customer but cost you significantly less resources.
Ultimately this is how businesses beat one another. Understanding this will be important as you scale your business.
Now that we’ve established the importance of the fulcrum and how to approach the sales-fulfillment balance at the outset,
let’s cover the last two steps of creating our Grand Slam offer. To recap quickly, remember that we covered identifying dream
outcomes (step one), listing problems (step two), and determining solutions (step three).
Step #4 Create Your Solutions Delivery Vehicles (“The How”)
The next step is thinking about all the things you could do to solve each of these problems you’ve identified. This is the
most important step in this process. This is what you are going to deliver. This is what you are going to do or provide in
exchange for money.
For the purposes of keeping creativity high (divergent thinking), think about anything you could possibly do. Think of all
the things that might enhance the value of your offer. So much so that they would be stupid to say no.
What could you do that someone would immediately say, “All that? Seriously? Yes, I'm in.”
Doing this exercise will make your job of selling So. Much. Easier.
Even if you come up with something you’re not actually willing to do, it’s okay. The goal here is to push your limits and jog
your brain into thinking of a different version of the solution you’d normally default to. This is where you get to flex your
entrepreneurial creativity.
Reminder: You only need to do this once. Literally one time for a product that may last years. This is high-value, highleverage
work. You ultimately get paid for thinking. You got this. This should be fun. Go ahead and list out all your
possibilities now. Then I’ll take you through my example. I’ll just use the buying food problem from earlier as an example. I
like to group things by how many people I'm going to deliver this thing to at once.
My list is below. And at the bottom, I’ve given you my “cheat codes” for how I think through this to get even more creative.
Problem: Buying Healthy Food Is Hard, Confusing, and I Won’t Like It
If I wanted to provide a one-on-one solution I might offer . . .
1. In-person grocery shopping, where I take clients to the store and teach them how to shop
2. Personalized grocery list, where I teach them how to make their list
3. Full-service shopping, where I buy their food for them. We’re talking 100 percent done for them.
4. In-person orientation (not at store), where I teach them what to get
5. Text support while shopping, where I help them if they get stuck
6. Phone call while grocery shopping, where I plan to call when they go shopping to provide direction and support
If I wanted to provide a small group solution I might offer . . .
1. In-person grocery shopping, where I meet a bunch of people and take them all shopping for themselves
2. Personalized grocery list, where I teach a bunch of people how to make their weekly lists. I could do this one time
or every week if I wanted to.
3. Buy their food for them, where I purchase their groceries and deliver them as well
4. In-person orientation, where I teach a small group offsite what to do (not at store)
If I wanted to provide a one to many solution I might offer . . .
1. Live grocery tour virtual, where I might live stream me going through the grocery store for all my new customers
and let them ask questions live
2. Recorded grocery tour, where I might shop once, record it, then give it as a reference point from that point onwards
for my clients to watch on their own
3. DIY grocery calculator, where I create a shareable tool or show them how to use a tool to calculate their grocery
list
4. Predetermined lists, where each customer plan comes with its own grocery list for each week. I could make this
ahead of time so they have it. Then they could use it on their own time
5. Grocery buddy system, where I could pair customers all up, which takes no time really, and let them go shopping
together
6. Pre-made, insta-cart grocery carts for delivery, where I could pre-make insta-cart lists so clients could have their
groceries delivered to their doorstep with one click
As you see, the list can really go on and on here. This is just to illustrate the many ways to solve a single problem.
Now do this for all of the perceived problems that your clients encounter before, after, and during their experience with
your service/products. You should have a monster list by the end of this.
Product Delivery Cheat Codes
What’s that? You’re having trouble being creative? I'm going to give you the cheat codes right now, kind of like I did with
the brick example: “the brick could be gold, or plastic, or have holes in it, or be a lego, etc.” Here are my “cheat codes” for
product variation/enhancement and a visual to break down the process for you from my consulting deck:
1. What level of personal attention do I want to provide? one-on-one, small group, one to many
2. What level of effort is expected from them? Do it themselves (DIY) - figure out how to do it on their own; do it
with them (DWY) - you teach them how to do it; done for them (DFY) - you do it for them
3. If doing something live, what environment or medium do I want to deliver it in? In-person, phone support, email
support, text support, Zoom support, chat support
4. If doing a recording, how do I want them to consume it? Audio, video, or written.
5. How quickly do we want to reply? On what days? during what hours? 24/7. 9-5, within 5 minutes, within an hour,
within 24 hrs?
6. 10x to 1/10th test. If my customers paid me 10x my price (or $100,000) what would I provide? If they paid me
1/10th the price and I had to make my product more valuable than it already is, how would I do that? How could I
still make them successful for 1/10th price? Stretch your mind in either direction and you’ll come up with widely
different solutions.
In other words, how could I actually deliver on these solutions I am claiming I will provide. Do this for each problem
because solutions from one problem will give you ideas for others you wouldn’t normally have considered.
Remember, it’s important that you solve every problem. I can’t tell you the amount of times one single item becomes the
reason someone doesn't buy.
Anecdote: Why We Must Solve Every Perceived Problem
When I was selling weight loss, I insisted that folks prepare all their food at home. I found it too difficult to help clients lose weight when they ate out
because they always blew their diets. Rather than solve the problem, I insisted they do it my way, or not at all. As a result, I lost many sales.
One month I really needed to make some sales to pay rent. My next sale walked in the door - it was a business exec looking to lose weight. As we got
into the sales presentation, she told me the program wouldn’t work for her because she went out to eat for lunch everyday. Normally, I would have lost this
sale. I was a stickler for making people not eat out. But I really needed the money. Refusing to lose the sale because of this one thing, I conceded “I’ll
make you an eating out guide for when you go to restaurants so you can eat our 100 percent of the time and still hit your goal. How does that sound?” She
agreed, and I closed the sale.
I took the time to make an eating out guide for her. But from that point going forward, whenever someone said “but what about eating out??” I had the
solution. Over time, I continued solving obstacles with templates and trainings until there were no more “one things” to prevent my sales. This lesson has
stuck with me to this day. Don’t get romantic about how you want to solve the problem. Find a way to solve every problem a prospect presents with. When
you do that, you make an offer that’s so good, people just can't say no. And that’s what we’re building here.
Note: You must resolve every obstacle a buyer believes they will have to convert the highest amount of people. That’s not to say that if you don't, you
won’t sell people. Not at all. But you won't sell as many people as you otherwise could have. And that’s the goal, to sell the most people, for the highest
possible price, with the highest possible margin.
Step #5: Trim & Stack
Now that we have enumerated our potential solutions, we will have a gigantic list. Next, I look at the cost of providing
these solutions to me (the business). I remove the ones that are high cost and low value first. Then I remove low cost, low
value items.
If you aren’t sure what’s high value, go through the value equation and ask yourself which of these things will this person:
1. Financially value
2. Cause them to believe they will be likely to succeed
3. Make them feel like they can do it with much less effort and sacrifice
4. Help them accomplish their goal and see the result they want with far less time investment.
What should remain are offer items that are 1) low cost, high value and 2) high cost, high value.
Example: Let’s say I moved in with someone and did their shopping, exercising, and cooking for them. They would
probably believe they would definitely lose weight. But I am not willing to do that for any amount of money short of a gazillion
dollars.
The next question becomes, is there a lesser version of this experience that I can deliver at scale?
Just take one step back at a time until you arrive at something that has a time commitment or cost you are willing to live
with (or, obviously, massively increase your price so it becomes worth it for you — i.e., the gazillion dollars to live with
someone).
If there’s one type of delivery vehicle to focus on, it’s creating high value, “one to many” solutions. These will be the ones
that typically have the biggest discrepancy between cost and value. For example, before I started my first gym, I had an online
training business. I created a small excel sheet application that after inputting all of someone’s goals, automatically generated
over 100 meals perfectly suited to their macronutrient and calorie needs. Better yet, depending which meals they selected,
would tell them what they needed to buy at the grocery store in exact amounts, and how to prepare them in bulk for their exact
amounts. It took me about 100 hours to put the whole thing together. But from that point going forward I sold truly personalized
eating plans for very expensive prices, but they only took me about 15minutes to make. High value. Low cost.
These types of solutions require a high, one-time cost of creation, but infinitely low additional effort after. (Fyi - This is
exactly why software becomes so valuable).
That doesn’t mean you don’t ever want to do something in a small group or one-on-one model. After all, I do 1-on-1 with
all of my portfolio company CEOs that we help scale past $30m+. You just want to make sure you save those high cost items
for big value adds only. If you think you can accomplish the same value with a lower cost alternative, then do that instead.
When I was running my gym, I went through this exercise and created: bulking blueprints, an eating-out system, a travel
eating and workout guide, meal plans for every bodyweight and gender, a grocery list calculator, plateau busting meal plans
(for when they got stuck), fast cooking guides partnered with meal prep services, and did in-person nutrition orientations with
every client one-on-one.
Many of the “one to many” solutions require more up front work. Once created, however, they become valuable assets that
create value in perpetuity. It’s worth putting in the time to create these because they will create high margin profit for years to
come.
Real talk: the meal plans I made for my gym have been used by 4,000+ gyms now and literally hundreds of thousands of
people. They are simple and easy to follow. So they have provided ample return for the week or two of dedicated time I spent
making them.
And if you ever have the desire to build a repeatable business model, something that scales, these assets you create will
become the bedrock. This book, for example, is a high-value asset that is low cost overall. Sure, it costs me a lot up front, but
each additional book I sell after my first one costs me very little and provides tremendous value.
The Final High Value Deliverable
Let’s sum this up before we configure our final high value deliverable.
Step #1: We figured out our prospective client's dream outcome.
Step #2: We listed out all the obstacles they’re likely to encounter on their way (our opportunities for value).
Step #3: We listed all those obstacles as solutions.
Step #4: We figured out all the different ways we could deliver those solutions.
Step #5a: We trimmed those ways down to only the things that were the highest value and lowest cost to us.
All we have to do now is…
Step #5b: Put all the bundles together into the ultimate high value deliverable.
So let’s go back to the example. We see our prospects struggled with the following:

Author Note
Most of our facilities now sell this bundle for longer periods of time for $2,400 to $5,200. Wild. As we got better at creating and monetizing value, the
prices and profit of our facilities skyrocketed. Once you start down this value creation process, each additional piece of value you create stacks on top over
time. This is why it is important to begin.
Can you see how much more valuable this is than a gym membership? The bundle does three core things:
1. Solves all the perceived problems (not just some)
2. Gives you the conviction that what you’re selling is one of a kind (very important)
3. Makes it impossible to compare or confuse your business or offering with the one down the street
Whew! We finally have what we are going to deliver in all its glory. That being said, it is unlikely we would present it in
this way. Depending on whether we sell one on one or one to many, we would present this differently. I will address how to
present each of these bundled items in the bonus section (next section).
Summary Points
We went through this entire process to accomplish one objective: to create a valuable offer that is differentiated and unable
to be compared to anything else in the marketplace. We are selling something unique. As such, we are no longer bound by the
normal pricing forces of commoditization. Prospects will now only make a value-based rather than a price-based decision on
whether they should buy from us. Hoorah!
Now that we have our core offer, the next section will be dedicated to enhancing it. We will employ a combination of
psychological levers: bonuses, urgency, scarcity, guarantees, and naming.
