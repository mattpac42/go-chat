# Guarantees and Naming: $100M Offers Knowledge Summary

## GUARANTEES: Reversing Risk

**Single greatest objection**: Risk that it doesn't work for them.

**Jason Fladlien's Data**: Changing guarantee quality can 2-4x conversion on same offer.

### The Math: Why Strong Guarantees Work

**Fear**: "Won't more people refund?"

**Reality**: Even if refunds double, net sales increase dramatically.

**Example**:
- Baseline: 100 sales, 5% refund (5 people) = 95 net sales
- Strong guarantee: 130 sales, 10% refund (13 people) = 117 net sales
- 117 ÷ 95 = 1.23x (23% more profit)

For guarantee to NOT be worth it, refund increase would need to 100% offset sales increase (extremely rare).

## Four Types of Guarantees

### 1. UNCONDITIONAL GUARANTEES

**Strongest form**: No questions asked, any reason, anytime.

**What Client Gets**:
- Full refund
- 50% refund
- Refund + ad spend + ancillary costs
- Pay for competitor's program instead
- Money back + additional $1,000

**Best For**: Lower-ticket B2C products (people often won't bother claiming).

**Jason Fladlien's Script** (100% his words):
"I'm not asking you to decide yes or no today...I'm asking you to make a fully informed decision. The only way you can make a fully informed decision is on the inside, not the outside. You get on the inside and see if everything we say is true and valuable to you. Then decide if it's for you. If it's not, no hard feelings... whether it's 29 minutes or 29 days from now...if you ain't happy, I ain't happy. Just tell us 'gimme my money' and you got it."

### 2. CONDITIONAL GUARANTEES

**Add "terms and conditions"** to the guarantee. Get very creative here.

Must do X, Y, Z to qualify. If they do those things and don't get result, you honor guarantee.

**Critical**: Make the conditions things that actually drive success. This gets clients results while protecting you.

**10 Conditional Guarantee Types**:

**A) Outsized Refund**:
- Double/triple their money back
- Payment of $X,XXX (far more than they paid)
- Jason Fladlien $27M example: "$2,997 course. Spend $X on ads using our methods. If you don't make money, I'll buy your store for $25,000 no questions asked."
- Result: $3M in extra sales, only 10 refunds ($2.75M net gain)

**B) Service Guarantee** (Author's Favorite):
- Keep working free until X is achieved
- No time limit, just outcome-focused
- Eliminates element of time
- Make conditional on key actions (setup webpage, attend calls, show up to workouts, report data)
- Reality: Almost never claimed because by the time it would be, client is close to goal or affection replaces memory of guarantee

**C) Modified Service Guarantee**:
- Give them another Y-long period free
- Y should be at least 2x original duration
- Keeps you on the hook for finite period (easier place to start)

**D) Credit-Based Guarantee**:
- Give back what they paid in credit toward any service
- Best for upsells (they already like what they have)
- Maintains goodwill

**E) Personal Service Guarantee**:
- You work with them one-on-one, free, until they reach X
- One of strongest guarantees
- Add conditions: 24-hour response, must use products you tell them, must XYZ
- Powerful as you scale and become more edified
- Put contingencies to make it unlikely they don't succeed

**F) Hotel + Airfare Perks**:
- If no value, reimburse product + hotel + airfare
- Great for workshops and in-person experiences
- More tangible than just product refund

**G) Wage-Payment Guarantee**:
- Pay their hourly rate if they don't find call/session valuable
- Ask for tax return ÷ 1,960 hours (no one will do this)
- Creative and original

**H) Release of Service**:
- Let them out of contract free
- Voids commitment or cancellation fee
- Powerful if you have enforceable contracts
- Even better if you DON'T enforce contracts (nothing to lose)

**I) Delayed Second Payment**:
- Won't bill again until they make first outcome
- Examples: Lose first 5 pounds, make first sale, get website live
- Gets prospect thinking in fast action terms
- Focuses team on client activation
- Great when you know what metric drives retention

**J) First Outcome Guarantee**:
- Continue to pay their ancillary costs (ad spend, hotel) until first outcome
- Example: "If you don't make first sale in 14 days, we pay your ad spend until you do"
- Keeps everyone focused on getting first dollar over the bridge

**Best For**: Higher-ticket B2B services (people actually read fine print).

### 3. ANTI-GUARANTEES

**"All Sales Are Final"**

**When to Use**:
- Product so valuable/exclusive that once seen, can't be unseen
- Service requires lots of work or customization
- Risk of exposure (proprietary processes, funnels, ads, metrics)
- Need strong "reason why"

**Examples**:

"All sales are final because our product is so exclusive and powerful that once used it cannot be unused. We're going to show you our proprietary process we use right now to generate leads. Our funnels, ads, metrics. We're exposing the inner workings of our business, so all sales are final."

"If you're the type of customer who needs a guarantee before taking a jump, you're not the type of person we want to work with. We want motivated self-starters who can follow instructions and aren't looking for a way out before they begin. If you're not serious, don't buy it. But if you are, boy are you going to make a killing."

**Makes product seem MORE valuable** through damaging admission.

### 4. IMPLIED GUARANTEES

**Performance-Based Models**: If you don't perform, they don't pay.

**Types**:
- **Performance**: Only pay per sale, per show, per pound lost
- **Revshare**: 10% of top line, 20% profit share, 25% of revenue growth from baseline
- **Profit-Share**: X% of profit, X% of gross profit
- **Ratchets**: 10% if over X, 20% if over Y, 30% if over Z
- **Bonuses/Triggers**: Get X when Y occurs

**Benefits**:
- Perfect alignment between client and provider
- Weeds out low performers
- Fosters collaboration and long-term relationship
- Most desirable setup

**Drawbacks**:
- Tracking and collection challenges

**Variation - Add Minimum**:
"Greater of $1,000 or 10% of revenue generated" (covers costs if client doesn't generate)

**Variation - Starter Period**:
"$1,000/mo for first 3 months, then 100% performance after" (covers setup time)

**Best For**: Quantifiable outcomes with transparency for measuring.

## Stacking Guarantees

**You can combine multiple guarantees**:
- Unconditional 30-day + Conditional triple-money-back 90-day
- Two conditional guarantees around sequential outcomes
- Example: "$10,000 by 60 days, $30,000 by 90 days as long as you do thing 1, 2, and 3"

**Effect**: Future-paces prospect into outcome. Shows you're serious. Shifts burden of risk from them to you.

## Naming Your Guarantee

**Generic (Bad)**: "30 Day Money Back Satisfaction Guarantee"

**Creative Imagery (Good)**: "In 30 days, if you wouldn't jump into shark-infested waters to get our product back, we'll return every dollar you paid"

**Creative Imagery (Great)**: "You'll get our famous 'Club a Baby Seal Guarantee' - After 30 days, if you wouldn't club a baby seal to stay on as a customer, you don't have to pay a penny"

Good names stick in minds and create emotional resonance.

## Creating Your Own Guarantee

**Process**:
1. Identify client's biggest fears, pain, and perceived obstacles
2. "What do they not want to have happen if they pay you?"
3. "What are they most afraid of?"
4. Reverse their fears into a guarantee
5. Consider time, emotion, and outside costs associated with program

**The more specific and creative, the better.**

## Important Warnings

**Quality Guarantees Can't Cover Bad Products**:
- If used to cover poor sales team or poor product, will backfire
- You'll get lots of refunds
- Guarantees are enhancers, not business builders

**High-Cost Services**:
- Use conditional or anti-guarantees
- Eating cost of refund + cost of fulfillment = too risky

**Guarantee Customers Are Different**:
- People who buy BECAUSE of guarantee may not put in work
- May become difficult customers
- Tie guarantee to actions they need to succeed (protects both parties)

# NAMING: The MAGIC Formula

**Purpose**: Your Grand Slam Offer won't make money if no one finds out about it.

**Reality**: Offers fatigue over time. Naming refreshes them without changing the core.

## Why Naming Matters

**Example**: "Free Six-Week Stress Release Challenge" vs "Float Tank Center Session"
- Same thing, different names
- First gets much higher response

**Local Markets**: Fatigue even faster
- $20 to reach 1,000 people
- 200,000 people in area = $10,000 to reach everyone
- After years (not months), offers can fatigue
- Solution: Rename the offer (change the wrapping paper)

## The MAGIC Formula

**M** - Make a Magnetic Reason Why
**A** - Announce Your Avatar
**G** - Give Them a Goal
**I** - Indicate a Time Interval
**C** - Complete with a Container Word

**Note**: Use 3-5 components. Not all mandatory. Shorter and punchier is better. Balance brevity and specificity.

### M - Magnetic "Reason Why"

Think like fraternity party planner. Reason can be anything.

**Examples**:
- Free, 88% off, Giveaway
- Spring, Summer, Back to School, Halloween, New Year
- Grand Opening, New Management, New Building, Anniversary

**Answers**: "Why are they making this offer?" OR "Why should I respond?" / "What's in it for me?"

### A - Announce Your Avatar

Call out your ideal avatar. Be as specific as possible, but no more.

**Local markets**: Go hyper-local (not Chicago, but Hinsdale).

**Examples**:
- Bee Cave Dentists
- Rolling Hills Moms
- Brick & Mortar Businesses
- Salon Owners
- Retired Athletes
- Brooklyn Busy Executives

### G - Give Them a Goal

Articulate dream outcome. Single word or phrase. Event, feeling, experience, outcome.

**More specific and tangible = better.**

**Examples**:
- Pain Free, Celebrity Smile, 1st Place, Never Out Of Breath
- Perfect Product, Grand Slam Offer, Little Black Dress
- Double Your Profit, First Client, High Ticket
- 7 Figure, 100k

### I - Indicate Time Interval

Duration to expect. How long results take.

**Platform Compliance Note**: Can't combine quantifiable claim with stated duration ("$10,000 in 10 days" violates rules). BUT "Make Your First Sale in 10 Days" is fine (not a quantifiable income claim).

**Examples**:
- 4 Hour
- 21 Day
- 6 Week
- 3 Month
- AA Minutes, BB Hours, CC Days, DD Weeks, Z Months

### C - Complete with Container Word

Denotes this is a bundle. A system. Something that can't be compared to commodity.

**Examples**:
- Challenge, Blueprint, Bootcamp, Intensive, Incubator
- Masterclass, Program, Detox, Experience, Summit
- Accelerator, Fast Track, Shortcut, Sprint, Launch
- Slingshot, Catapult, Explosion, System, Getaway
- Meetup, Transformation, Mastermind, Game Plan
- Deep Dive, Workshop, Comeback, Rebirth, Attack
- Assault, Reset, Solution, Hack, Cheatcode, Liftoff

**Examples**:
- Six-Pack Fast Track
- 5-Day Book Print Sprint
- Marriage Thrive Deep Dive
- 12-Week 2-Putt Shortcut
- 12-Month No-Debt Reset

### Alliteration

**Example**: Transform "Meal Plan" into "Personalized Lick Your Fingers Good Meal Plan...so good it'll be easier to follow than eating what you used to 'cheat' with and cost less! ($500 value)"

## What to Change When Offers Fatigue

**Order of changes** (lightest to heaviest):

1. **Change creative** (images/pictures in ads)
2. **Change body copy** in ads
3. **Change headline** - the "wrapper" of offer
   - Free 6 Week Lean Challenge → Free 6 Week Tone Challenge
   - Holiday Hangover → New Year New You
4. **Change duration** (6 weeks → 28 days or 8 weeks)
5. **Change enhancer** (free/discount component)
6. **Change monetization structure** and price points

**Most of the time**: Only need to change first handful. Repeat again and again without touching bottom items.

**Lower on list = more operationally heavy**. Exhaust easier variations first.

## Local Business Marketing

**Easier to get working** (in-person trust, higher conversion)

**Harder to keep working** (limited radius, faster fatigue)

**Solution**: Rapidly variate offers, headlines, creative
- Don't change value stack
- Change how it looks in marketing
- Rotate seasonal wrappers
- Update monthly or quarterly

## Testing & Optimization

1. Create 2-3 working names
2. Test in advertising campaign
3. Note the winner
4. Use winner as control
5. Test new names against control
6. Repeat

**Some names will inexplicably convert better.** Don't be emotional. Keep testing.

## Implementation Summary

**Remember**:
- Don't change actual offer
- Don't change fulfillment
- Don't change what you do for clients

**DO change**:
- Wrapper/presentation
- Seasonal angle
- Duration framing
- Who it's for (avatar specificity)
- Time to achievement emphasis
- Container word variety

**Same work. Different perception. Dramatically different response rates.**

## Final Wisdom

**Guarantees**: "The extent to which you reverse risk determines how many people buy."

**Naming**: "Half-ass naming your product or offering can ruin conversions. People judge a book by its cover."

Combined properly, the right guarantee + the right name can 2-10x response rates on the same offer.

Your job: Make prospects think "I'd be stupid to say no" (guarantee) and "This is exactly for me" (naming).
