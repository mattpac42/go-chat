# Enhancement Tactics: Scarcity, Urgency, and Bonuses

## Core Principle: The Delicate Dance of Desire

**Fundamental truth**: Desire comes from NOT having what you want.

"Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want." - Naval Ravikant

**The Perfect Profit Combination**: Lots of demand + very little supply (or perceived supply).

### Hormozi Law
"The longer you delay the ask, the bigger the ask you can make. The longer the runway, the bigger the plane that can take off."

## Supply and Demand Psychology

**Key Insight**: People want what they can't have. People want what others want. People want what only a select few have access to.

**Arnold Fundraiser Example**:
- Raised price from $15,000 to $25,000 per ticket
- Cut tickets from more than 100 to exactly 100
- Result: Raised extra $1M before event started
- Total: $5.4M from 100 people ($54,000 per head!)

**When demand increases, cut supply.**

### The Dangerous Opposite

If you satisfy ALL demand:
- Kill your golden goose
- Don't know where next meal comes from
- Each successive promotion sells fewer units
- Eventually run out of demand

**Solution**: Keep supply under demand. Leave people wanting more.

## SCARCITY: Three Types

### 1. Limited Supply of Seats/Slots
- "Only accepting X clients total" (Total Business Cap)
- "Only accepting X clients per week" (Growth Rate Cap)
- "Only accepting X clients per cohort" (Cohort Cap)

**Physical Products**: Limited releases for flavors, colors, designs, sizes.
- Always sell out (better to consistently sell out than over-order)
- Announce when sold out (social proof + increased desire)
- Monthly releases are the sweet spot

**Chanel Example**: Sends only 1-2 of each piece to each store. Every store has different selection. Every item is last or second-to-last in stock. Maintains insane margins for over a century.

### 2. Limited Supply of Bonuses
- "First X people get [bonus]"
- "Only available until [date]"
- Creates stacking effect with main offer

### 3. Never Available Again
- One-time only offers
- Exclusive access that disappears
- "If you leave, you can never come back"

### Honest Scarcity (Most Ethical)

Simply tell the truth about your capacity.

- "81% to capacity this month"
- "3 of 5 spots taken this week"
- "Only 25 total clients accepted at this service level"

**Scarcity implies social proof**: If you're almost full, people made the decision to work with you.

## URGENCY: Four Types

**Scarcity = Function of quantity. Urgency = Function of time.**

### 1. Cohort-Based Rolling Urgency

"If you sign up today, you can get in with our next group that kicks off on Monday. Otherwise you'll have to wait until our next kickoff date."

**Enhanced version**: "I had a client drop out, so I have an opening for Monday's cohort. If you're pretty sure you're gonna do this sooner or later, might as well start Monday and start reaping rewards sooner."

**What if they miss deadline?**
- Offer personalized speedier onboarding as "bonus" for signing up OR
- Extended payment plan only available since start date is far out
- You always have the advantage because you call the shots

### 2. Rolling Seasonal Urgency

Use calendar events as natural deadlines:
- New Year Promotion (ends Jan 30)
- Valentine's Lovers Promo (ends Feb 28)
- Sexy By Spring Special (ends March 31)
- Fools in Love April Promo (ends April 30)

Same core service, different seasonal wrapper. Creates novelty + urgency.

**Best for**: Local businesses (must vary marketing more frequently than national advertisers).

### 3. Pricing or Bonus-Based Urgency

"Let's get you started today so you can take advantage of this discount. I'm not sure how long we'll run it as we change them every 4 weeks, and this is one of the better ones."

Create fear of missing out on the promotion/discount/bonuses, not the core service.

**Price Change Tactic**: Clean your pipeline by announcing "Price is going up! Get in now!" Never raise prices without warning.

### 4. Exploding Opportunity

The opportunity itself has a ticking clock.
- Market arbitrage opportunities
- Platform advantages before competition arrives
- Stock/crypto opportunities
- Job offers that decrease in value daily

**Emphasis**: Every second delayed = disproportionate gains missed.

## BONUSES: The Stack That Breaks Their Mind

**Core Principle**: A single offer is less valuable than the same offer broken into component parts and stacked as bonuses.

**Why it works**: Every infomercial uses "But wait...there's more!" because it's ROI-positive. They wouldn't waste airtime if it didn't convert.

### The Psychology

1. Anchor the price to core offer
2. Stack bonuses that expand the price-to-value discrepancy
3. Each bonus makes the "rubber band" stretch wider
4. Eventually it snaps their resistance

**Strategy**: Add bonuses instead of discounting. Never discount the main offer. It teaches customers prices are negotiable.

### The 11 Bonus Bullets

**1. Always offer them** (weaponize your trim & stack deliverables)

**2. Give them special names** with benefits in title
- Bad: "Meal Plan"
- Good: "Personalized Lick Your Fingers Good Meal Plan"

**3. Tell them the full story**:
- How it relates to their issue
- What it is
- How you discovered/created it
- How it improves their lives (faster, easier, less sacrifice)

**4. Provide proof** (stat, past client, or personal experience)

**5. Paint vivid mental picture** of life with benefits

**6. Ascribe a price tag** and justify it
- "Save $200/month on groceries = $2,400/year value"
- "Get back 200 hours per year = $600 value at $3/hr"

**7. Tools & checklists beat trainings** (less effort/time = higher value per Value Equation)

**8. Address specific concerns** that prevent success

**9. Solve their next problem** before they encounter it

**10. Bonus value should eclipse core offer value**
- Psychological trigger: "If THESE are the bonuses, the main thing must be incredibly valuable!"

**11. Add scarcity & urgency to bonuses themselves**:
- "Only first 3 people get XYZ bonus"
- "If you buy today, you get XYZ (normally $1,000) free"

### Advanced: Other People's Products/Services

Get other businesses to give you their products/services as bonuses in exchange for exposure.

**Pain Clinic Example**:
- Free massages from massage therapist
- Free adjustments from chiropractors (get 10 chiros = 10 free adjustments in bundle)
- Discounts from low-inflammation food company
- Discounts on braces/orthotics
- Free personal training session + gym membership month
- Pharmaceutical discounts from pharmacist

**$400 offer now has $800+ in free bonuses.**

**Jedi Level**: Negotiate group discount + commission to yourself.
- Clients get 30% discount
- You get 40% commission on sales
- Business gets new customers

**$400 offer + $800 in bonuses + $350 in affiliate commissions = $750 pure profit per customer.**

### Presenting Bonuses

**One-on-One Selling**:
1. Ask for the sale FIRST (before bonuses)
2. If they say YES → Give bonuses after as "wow" experience
3. If they say NO → Present bonus matching their obstacle, then ask again
4. Keep stacking bonuses until they feel obligated (reciprocity)

**Group Selling**:
- Present bonuses in the stack upfront
- Build to crescendo
- "But wait, there's more!"

## Real-World Examples

### Arnold Fundraiser Auction
- Every item was one-of-a-kind (scarcity)
- If you missed it, never available again (urgency)
- Arnold threw in bonuses when bidding got high (bonuses)
- Items that wouldn't sell for $10,000 elsewhere sold for $100,000

**Products remained unchanged. Setting and psychology created 10x value.**

### Limited Edition Releases
- Musician drops 100 hoodies, never made again
- Supreme limited drops
- Tesla limited production runs
- More likely to buy when you can never get it again

### Gym Launch Pricing Evolution
Early stage: Flew out for 21 days, did everything, took all risk
- Scarcity: Only could do 8 gyms/month
- Urgency: "Reserve your date" (spots filling fast)
- Bonuses: Kept 100% of cash collected, they got free clients
- Result: $100,000/month personal income

Scaled: Taught them how to do it
- Scarcity: Only accepting X gyms per week
- Urgency: "Next cohort kicks off Monday"
- Bonuses: Daily sales coaching, tested scripts, price points, recordings, entire playbook
- Result: Helped 4,000+ gyms, $4.4M/month revenue

## Critical Implementation Rules

**Scarcity**:
- Must be real (lose credibility if fake)
- Always sell out
- Always announce when sold out
- Works best with higher-ticket upsells

**Urgency**:
- Must have real deadline
- Deadlines drive decisions
- Test different timeframes (24 hours, 3 days, 7 days, 30 days)
- Last 4 hours of last day = 50-60% of sales

**Bonuses**:
- Never discount core offer, add bonuses instead
- Stack until price-to-value discrepancy is absurd
- Each bonus should solve a specific obstacle
- Total bonus value > core offer value

## What You Actually Change

**DON'T change**:
- Core service/product
- Actual fulfillment
- What you do for clients

**DO change**:
- How many people can access it (scarcity)
- When people can access it (urgency)
- What they get in addition to it (bonuses)
- How you present it (stack)

**Same work. Dramatically different perceived value.**

## Key Formulas

**Guarantee Impact on Conversion**:
- Weak guarantee → Baseline conversion
- Strong guarantee → 2-4x conversion (Jason Fladlien data)

**Refund Math**:
- 100 sales, 5% refund = 95 net sales
- 130 sales, 10% refund = 117 net sales
- 117/95 = 23% profit increase

**Even if refunds double, net profit increases significantly.**

## Action Steps

1. **Implement scarcity**: Choose one type (business cap, growth cap, or cohort cap)
2. **Add urgency**: Create cohort kickoff dates or seasonal promotions
3. **Stack bonuses**: Take trim & stack deliverables and present separately with values
4. **Test combinations**: Try different scarcity + urgency + bonus combinations
5. **Track metrics**: Measure response rates, conversion rates, and net sales
6. **Always sell out**: Better to have less supply than to fail at creating scarcity
7. **Compound over time**: Each sold-out event increases desire for next one

## Final Wisdom

"When demand increases, cut supply." - George (Arnold's fundraiser advisor)

"The person who needs the exchange less always has the upper hand."

These tactics don't make a business - they enhance a good offer. If you use them to cover up poor product or poor sales, they'll backfire into refunds.

Use them to make a great offer irresistible. Make prospects think "I'd be stupid to say no."

The goal: Ravenous prospects who jump at the opportunity because they know it won't last forever, can't accommodate everyone, and comes with so much bonus value they can't refuse.
