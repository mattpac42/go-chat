## Three Common Starting Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "We're a startup getting to $5M - what systems do we need?"

**Recommended Path** (6-9 months):

**Month 1-2**: Build execution foundation
- **Agent**: scalingup-execution-habits-coach
- **Outcome**: Daily 5-minute huddles, weekly 90-minute meetings, Who-What-When tracking

**Month 3-4**: Define culture and strategy
- **Agents**: scalingup-people-culture-coach + scalingup-strategy-planning-coach (parallel)
- **Outcome**: 3-5 core values, one-page strategic plan

**Month 5-6**: Add accountability systems
- **Agents**: scalingup-execution-priorities-coach + scalingup-execution-metrics-coach
- **Outcome**: Quarterly rocks, 7-10 KPI scorecard

**Month 7-9**: Build people systems
- **Agents**: scalingup-people-hiring-coach + scalingup-people-retention-coach
- **Outcome**: Job scorecards, love/loathe retention system

---

### Scenario 2: "We're stuck at $10M for 2 years - what's the constraint?"

**Recommended Path**:

**Step 1**: Comprehensive assessment (1 week)
- **Agent**: scalingup-growth-advisor
- **Outcome**: 4-pillar scores (People, Strategy, Execution, Cash), primary constraint identified

**Step 2**: Address primary constraint (90 days)
- **Agent**: Specialist coach for weakest pillar
- **Example**: If cash is 4/10 (weakest), use scalingup-cash-management-coach
- **Outcome**: Cash conversion cycle optimized, 13-week forecast implemented

**Step 3**: Address secondary constraint (next 90 days)
- **Agent**: Specialist coach for second-weakest pillar
- **Outcome**: Balanced improvement across pillars

**Step 4**: Ongoing optimization (quarterly)
- **Agent**: scalingup-growth-advisor coordinates all specialist coaches
- **Outcome**: 2-3x growth over 12-24 months

---

### Scenario 3: "We're scaling fast (50%+ growth) - what breaks first?"

**Recommended Path** (quarterly sprints):

**Q1**: Cash and execution
- **Agents**: scalingup-cash-management-coach + scalingup-execution-priorities-coach
- **Outcome**: 13-week cash forecast, quarterly priority discipline
- **Why**: Fast growth consumes cash and creates chaos without focus

**Q2**: People systems
- **Agents**: scalingup-people-hiring-coach + scalingup-people-retention-coach
- **Outcome**: Top grading hiring, onboarding that retains A players
- **Why**: Growth requires A players hired fast and kept long-term

**Q3**: Execution discipline
- **Agents**: scalingup-execution-habits-coach + scalingup-execution-metrics-coach
- **Outcome**: Meeting rhythms, scorecards, accountability systems
- **Why**: Scale requires systems, not heroics

**Q4**: Strategy clarity
- **Agent**: scalingup-strategy-planning-coach
- **Outcome**: One-page strategic plan everyone can execute against
- **Why**: Growth without strategy leads to waste and confusion

## How to Work with an Agent

### Step 1: Choose the Right Agent

Use the decision tree above or start with **scalingup-growth-advisor** for assessment.

### Step 2: Provide Context

Agents will ask clarifying questions. Be ready with:
- Company basics (revenue, employees, growth stage)
- Specific problem or goal
- Previous attempts to solve this
- Current state (what exists today)
- Desired outcomes (what success looks like)

### Step 3: Receive Recommendations

Agents provide:
- Frameworks and templates
- Step-by-step implementation guidance
- Real examples from Scaling Up course
- Action plans with timelines

### Step 4: Implement and Iterate

- Start with agent's recommendations
- Track progress against success criteria
- Return to agent for refinement and next steps
- Engage next agent in sequence if building systems

## Best Practices

### DO:
✅ Start with assessment if problem is complex (use growth-advisor)
✅ Build foundation first (habits before priorities, culture before hiring)
✅ Give systems time to stabilize before adding more
✅ Use knowledge base summaries for deeper learning
✅ Engage multiple agents for systemic transformation

### DON'T:
❌ Jump to metrics before establishing meeting rhythms
❌ Implement hiring systems before defining core values
❌ Chase 20 initiatives at once (use priorities coach for focus)
❌ Ignore cash implications of strategic decisions
❌ Rush from one agent to next without implementation time

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I use multiple agents at once?**
A: Yes, but thoughtfully. Some work well in parallel (culture + strategy), others need sequence (habits → priorities → metrics).

**Q: Which agent should I start with if everything is broken?**
A: Start with **scalingup-growth-advisor** for assessment, then follow their recommendations for specialist engagement.

**Q: How long does it take to implement Scaling Up fully?**
A: 12-24 months for comprehensive implementation across all 4 pillars. But you'll see results from individual agents in 4-6 weeks.

**Q: Do I need all 9 agents?**
A: Not immediately. Most companies need 3-5 agents over first year. Growth advisor helps prioritize.

**Q: What if my specific issue isn't listed?**
A: Describe your challenge to **scalingup-growth-advisor**. They'll assess and recommend the right specialist coach(s).
