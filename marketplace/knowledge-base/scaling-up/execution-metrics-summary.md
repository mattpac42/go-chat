# Scaling Up: Execution Metrics Summary

## The Scoreboard Principle

"Without data, you're just another person with an opinion." - W. Edwards Deming

In scaling organizations, metrics transform subjective debates into objective problem-solving. The right scorecard tells you whether you're winning or losing before the final score is posted.

## Thermometers vs. Thermostats

### Thermometer Metrics (Lagging Indicators)
**What They Measure**: Results after they happen
**Examples**:
- Monthly revenue
- Quarterly profit
- Annual customer retention
- Year-end market share

**Value**: Show final outcomes
**Limitation**: Too late to change the result

### Thermostat Metrics (Leading Indicators)
**What They Measure**: Activities that predict future results
**Examples**:
- Daily sales calls → predicts monthly revenue
- Weekly product demos → predicts quarterly new customers
- Daily quality checks → predicts monthly defect rates
- Weekly customer health scores → predicts annual retention

**Value**: Early warning system, allows course correction
**Power**: Change inputs to change outputs

## The KPI Framework

### Characteristics of Effective KPIs

**1. Actionable**
- You can influence the number through specific actions
- Team knows what to do differently if metric is red

**2. Simple**
- Anyone can understand calculation
- No PhD required to interpret

**3. Visible**
- Updated frequently (daily or weekly)
- Displayed where team sees it constantly

**4. Team-Based**
- Team owns the metric collectively
- Drives peer accountability

**5. Leading**
- Predicts future performance
- Provides time to adjust

### The Daily Metric Rule

**Principle**: Every critical function should have at least one daily metric

**Why Daily?**
- Weekly metrics allow 5 days of drift
- Daily metrics catch problems in 24 hours
- Creates sense of urgency and momentum

**Examples by Function**:

**Sales**:
- Outbound calls/emails made
- Demos scheduled
- Pipeline value added

**Customer Success**:
- Customer health scores (red/yellow/green count)
- Support tickets resolved
- Product adoption metrics (daily active users)

**Operations**:
- Units produced
- Defect rate
- On-time delivery percentage

**Finance**:
- Cash balance
- Accounts receivable over 60 days
- Daily burn rate

## Scoreboard Design Principles

### The One-Page Dashboard

**Rule**: All critical metrics fit on one page (or screen)
**Why**: Forces prioritization, ensures visibility

### Visual Management

**Red-Yellow-Green Color Coding**:
- **Green**: On target or better (≥95% of goal)
- **Yellow**: Slightly off (85-94% of goal)
- **Red**: Significantly off (<85% of goal)

**Trend Arrows**:
- ↑ Improving
- → Flat
- ↓ Declining

**Example Dashboard Layout**:

## The 7-10 Metric Rule

**Challenge**: Teams want to track everything (50+ metrics)
**Problem**: Dilutes focus, creates noise
**Solution**: Limit to 7-10 metrics maximum

**How to Choose**:
1. Start with company strategic theme
2. Identify the 3-4 metrics that measure theme success
3. Add 3-4 metrics for critical business operations
4. Include 1-2 culture/people metrics

**Mom's Organic Market Example**:
When theme was "Strengthen Store Operations," they tracked:
1. Shrink percentage (daily by store)
2. Customer transactions per hour
3. Average basket size
4. Labor as % of sales
5. Employee turnover rate
6. Store cleanliness scores (mystery shopper)
7. Local product percentage

**Total**: 7 metrics. Everything else was noise relative to the theme.

## Cascading Metrics

### Company → Department → Team → Individual

**Company Level**: Strategic metrics tied to annual/quarterly themes

**Department Level**: Metrics that roll up to company metrics

**Team Level**: Weekly metrics that predict departmental performance

**Individual Level**: Personal accountability metrics

**Example Cascade - Revenue Growth Theme**:

**Company**:
- Quarterly revenue growth: 25%

**Sales Department**:
- Monthly new customer acquisitions: 15
- Average deal size: $50K

**Sales Team (Enterprise)**:
- Weekly qualified opportunities: 8
- Demo-to-close rate: 30%

**Individual Rep (Sarah)**:
- Daily outbound touches: 30
- Weekly demos conducted: 5

**The Connection**: Sarah's daily activities → team weekly results → department monthly goals → company quarterly theme

## The Weekly Metrics Meeting

### Agenda (15-20 minutes)

**1. Celebrate Wins (3 min)**
- Which metrics are green?
- What's working?

**2. Review Yellows (5 min)**
- What's at risk?
- What's the plan to get back to green?

**3. Problem-Solve Reds (10 min)**
- What's broken?
- Root cause analysis
- Assign action items (Who-What-When)

**4. Forward Look (2 min)**
- What could turn yellow/red next week?
- Preventive actions needed?

### The "No Excuses" Rule

**What Happens**: Team member explains why metric is red
**Old Way**: "Understood, try harder next week"
**New Way**: "What specifically will you do differently this week to get back to green?"

Focus on actions, not explanations.

## Common Metric Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Too Many Metrics
**Symptom**: 30+ metric dashboard
**Solution**: "What are the 5 numbers that tell us if we're winning?"

### Mistake 2: All Lagging Indicators
**Symptom**: Monthly/quarterly metrics only
**Solution**: Add daily/weekly leading indicators that predict lagging results

### Mistake 3: Metrics Without Owners
**Symptom**: No one accountable for improving red metrics
**Solution**: Every metric has a single owner (can have contributors, but one owner)

### Mistake 4: Set-and-Forget Dashboards
**Symptom**: Metrics created but never reviewed
**Solution**: Weekly review ritual, metrics on big screens in offices

### Mistake 5: Vanity Metrics
**Symptom**: Metrics that look good but don't drive business results
**Solution**: Ask "If this metric improves, does revenue/profit/customer satisfaction improve?"

## Advanced Metric Concepts

### The Linked Metrics System

Identify how metrics influence each other:

**Example - SaaS Business**:
- Daily product logins → Weekly active users → Monthly retention → Quarterly revenue

If daily logins drop, you know retention will drop in 30 days. Fix it now.

### The Ratio Method

Sometimes the best metric is a ratio:

**Examples**:
- Revenue per employee (productivity)
- Customer acquisition cost / Customer lifetime value (CAC/LTV)
- Gross profit per labor hour (operational efficiency)
- Support tickets per customer (product quality)

**Power**: Ratios normalize for growth, show true efficiency

### The Benchmark Approach

**Internal Benchmarks**: Our performance vs. our history
- "Are we better than last quarter?"

**External Benchmarks**: Our performance vs. industry/competitors
- "Are we better than peer companies?"

**Best Practice**: Track both, but focus on internal improvement

## Implementation Roadmap

### Month 1: Foundation
1. Identify 7-10 critical metrics
2. Assign ownership
3. Create simple dashboard
4. Establish weekly review meeting

### Month 2: Refinement
1. Validate leading indicators predict lagging results
2. Adjust goals based on baseline data
3. Add visualizations (charts, trends)
4. Train team on interpretation

### Month 3: Scale
1. Cascade to department level
2. Integrate with Who-What-When tracking
3. Tie to quarterly rocks
4. Automate data collection where possible

## Real-World Examples

### Atlassian's "Triple Crown" Metric

For years, Atlassian tracked three numbers:
1. New customer acquisitions
2. Existing customer expansion revenue
3. Customer retention rate

**Why These Three**: Together they perfectly predicted quarterly revenue. Nothing else mattered as much.

### Zappos Customer Service Metrics

**Traditional Call Center**: Average handle time (get customers off phone fast)
**Zappos**: Customer happiness score (make customers thrilled)

**Result**: Zappos deliberately had longer calls but higher satisfaction, leading to higher lifetime value and word-of-mouth referrals.

**Lesson**: Measure what matters to strategy, not industry conventions.

## The Bottom Line

Metrics are the language of scaling. Companies that master measurement scale predictably. Those that fly blind crash spectacularly.

**The Discipline**:
1. Measure what matters (not what's easy)
2. Review religiously (weekly minimum)
3. Act on insights (metrics without action are vanity)
4. Simplify constantly (less is more)

**Start Here**: Pick 7 metrics that answer this question: "If I only knew 7 numbers each week, which ones would tell me if we're winning or losing?"

Track them. Review them. Act on them. Scale.
