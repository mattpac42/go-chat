# Scaling Up: Execution Priorities Summary

## Core Philosophy: Keep the Main Thing the Main Thing

The greatest challenge in scaling organizations is focus. As companies grow, opportunities multiply faster than resources. The ability to identify and maintain focus on THE priority that matters most becomes the key differentiator between companies that scale successfully and those that plateau or collapse.

## The Quarterly Theme Approach

### What is a Quarterly Theme?

A quarterly theme is a single, organization-wide priority that provides crystal-clear focus for 13 weeks. It answers the question: "If we could only accomplish ONE thing this quarter, what would move the business forward most significantly?"

### Characteristics of Effective Themes

**Specific and Measurable**:
- Not "improve customer service" but "reduce customer response time to under 4 hours"
- Not "increase sales" but "land 10 enterprise contracts over $100k"

**Urgent and Important**:
- Addresses a critical constraint or opportunity
- Has meaningful business impact
- Creates momentum

**Rallying and Unifying**:
- Everyone can understand their role
- Crosses departmental boundaries
- Generates energy and commitment

## The Mark Zuckerberg "Get Mobile" Example

In 2012, Facebook faced an existential threat: mobile usage was exploding, but Facebook's mobile experience was terrible and generated zero revenue.

**The Theme**: "Get Mobile"

**What Happened**:
- Every team aligned around mobile-first development
- Weekly all-hands meetings tracked mobile metrics
- Desktop features frozen unless they supported mobile
- Engineering teams reorganized around mobile platforms
- Within 18 months: mobile revenue went from $0 to majority of total revenue

**Key Lesson**: The theme was so clear that every employee could make daily decisions aligned with it. Engineers knew what to build. Designers knew what to prioritize. Sales knew what to sell.

## Identifying Your Quarterly Theme

### The Constraint Analysis Method

1. **Identify the Current Constraint**: What single factor is most limiting growth?
   - Market awareness?
   - Product capability?
   - Operational capacity?
   - Cash flow?
   - Team capability?

2. **Theory of Constraints Questions**:
   - What is preventing us from growing 2x?
   - If we solved X, what would become the next constraint?
   - Where is the bottleneck in our system?

3. **Test the Theme**:
   - If we solve this, does it unlock significant growth?
   - Can we make meaningful progress in 13 weeks?
   - Will every department contribute?

### The OGSM Framework for Theme Selection

**Objective**: Where are we going? (Long-term aspiration)
**Goals**: What will we achieve this quarter? (Measurable outcomes)
**Strategies**: How will we get there? (Broad approaches)
**Measures**: How will we track progress? (Leading and lagging indicators)

**Example - SaaS Company**:
- **Objective**: Become the leading platform in our vertical
- **Goal**: Reduce customer churn from 5% to 3% this quarter
- **Strategy**: Implement customer success program for high-value accounts
- **Measures**:
  - Weekly: customer health scores, support response times
  - Monthly: retention rates by segment, NPS scores

## The 3-5 Rock System

Once the quarterly theme is set, identify 3-5 "rocks" (quarterly priorities) that support the theme.

### Rock Selection Criteria

**Must Support the Theme**: Every rock should directly advance the quarterly theme
**Assigned to One Owner**: Single point of accountability
**Achievable in 90 Days**: Realistic scope
**Measurable**: Clear definition of "done"

### Mom's Organic Market Example

**Q2 2023 Theme**: "Strengthen Store Operations"

**Rocks**:
1. **Rock 1**: Reduce shrink (inventory loss) from 3.2% to 2.5% (Owner: Operations VP)
2. **Rock 2**: Implement new POS system in 5 pilot stores (Owner: IT Director)
3. **Rock 3**: Complete Level 1 manager training for all 40 store managers (Owner: HR Director)
4. **Rock 4**: Launch local supplier program in DC market (Owner: Merchandising VP)

**Result**: 80% of rocks achieved, shrink reduced to 2.6%, operations significantly strengthened.

**Key Insight**: Only 4 rocks for entire company. Everything else was either business-as-usual or explicitly deprioritized.

## Cascade and Alignment

### The Cascade Process

**Week 1**: Leadership team sets company theme and rocks
**Week 2**: Department heads set departmental rocks aligned to company rocks
**Week 3**: Team leads set team priorities aligned to departmental rocks
**Week 4**: Individuals set personal priorities aligned to team priorities

### Alignment Check Questions

For every priority at every level:
- How does this support the company theme?
- If we don't do this, what happens to the company rocks?
- What are we explicitly NOT doing to focus on this?

## The "Stop Doing" List

Focus requires subtraction as much as addition.

### Creating Your Stop-Doing List

**Question 1**: What activities consume resources but don't support the theme?
**Question 2**: What "good ideas" must wait until next quarter?
**Question 3**: What meetings/reports can be suspended for 90 days?

### Atlassian Example

When Atlassian focused on enterprise market penetration (quarterly theme), they explicitly stopped:
- New feature development for small team products
- All conferences under 1,000 attendees
- Marketing campaigns targeting individual users
- Product integrations with low enterprise adoption

**Result**: Enterprise revenue grew 300% in 12 months because resources were ruthlessly focused.

## Weekly Priority Tracking

### Who-What-When Format

Every rock breaks down into weekly commitments:

**Example Rock**: "Launch customer success program for top 50 accounts"

**Week 1 Commitments**:
- **Who**: Sarah (CS Director)
- **What**: Define customer health scoring model with 5 metrics
- **When**: Friday 5 PM

- **Who**: Mike (Engineering)
- **What**: Export top 50 account usage data for analysis
- **When**: Wednesday 12 PM

- **Who**: Jennifer (Sales)
- **What**: Schedule kickoff calls with 10 target accounts
- **When**: Friday 3 PM

### The Red-Yellow-Green System

**Green**: On track, no issues
**Yellow**: At risk, needs attention
**Red**: Off track, requires leadership intervention

Review in weekly meetings. Red items get immediate problem-solving focus.

## The Power of Saying No

### The Warren Buffett 25/5 Rule Applied to Quarterly Planning

1. List 25 potential priorities
2. Circle the top 5
3. The other 20 become your "avoid at all costs" list
4. They're dangerous because they're good ideas that dilute focus

### How Great Leaders Say No

**Not**: "That's a bad idea"
**Instead**: "Great idea. Let's add it to our list for Q3 evaluation. Right now, we're 100% focused on [theme]."

## Common Priority Management Pitfalls

### The "Everything is Important" Trap
**Symptom**: 10+ company priorities
**Solution**: Force-rank and cut. If everything is important, nothing is.

### The "Shiny Object" Syndrome
**Symptom**: Theme changes mid-quarter based on latest opportunity
**Solution**: Quarterly commitment means quarterly. New opportunities go to next quarter's evaluation.

### The "Departmental Silo" Problem
**Symptom**: Department priorities don't align with company theme
**Solution**: Cascade process with explicit alignment checks

### The "Underestimating Scope" Issue
**Symptom**: Rocks consistently incomplete
**Solution**: Better upfront estimation, quarterly retrospectives to improve planning

## Measuring Priority Effectiveness

### Leading Indicators
- Weekly rock status (% on track)
- Cross-functional collaboration score
- Resource allocation alignment (% of budget/time on rocks)

### Lagging Indicators
- Rock completion rate (target: 80%+)
- Theme achievement (did we accomplish the big goal?)
- Momentum (did completing rocks unlock next constraint?)

## The Quarterly Rhythm

**Week 1**: Launch energy, clarity high
**Weeks 2-8**: Execution mode, maintain momentum
**Weeks 9-11**: Push to finish, escalate stuck items
**Week 12**: Review, celebrate, plan next quarter
**Week 13**: Buffer week, prep for next quarter launch

## Bottom Line

Organizations that master priority focus achieve 3-5x more strategic progress than those managing 20+ initiatives. The discipline to choose ONE theme per quarter and align everyone around it separates scaling winners from also-rans.

**The Brutal Truth**: You can do anything, but you can't do everything. Choose wisely. Execute relentlessly. Review honestly. Repeat.

**Start Here**: This week, answer one question: "What is THE one thing that, if we accomplished it this quarter, would make everything else easier or unnecessary?"
