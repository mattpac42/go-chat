## System Philosophy

**Scaling Up is a discipline, not an event.**

These 9 agents help companies implement Verne Harnish's methodology systematically:
- One framework at a time
- One pillar at a time
- With proven tools and real examples
- Building toward predictable, profitable scaling

**The 4 Pillars Must Stay Balanced**:
- **People**: A-player team with strong culture
- **Strategy**: Clear differentiation and core customer focus
- **Execution**: Rockefeller Habits and accountability rhythms
- **Cash**: Working capital optimization and customer-funded models

**Growth requires balance.** Weakness in any pillar limits growth regardless of strength in others. These agents ensure comprehensive, balanced improvement.
