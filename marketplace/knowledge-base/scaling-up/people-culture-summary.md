# Scaling Up: People & Culture Summary

## The Foundation: Culture Eats Strategy for Breakfast

Peter Drucker's famous observation has proven true for decades: the best strategy in the world fails without the right culture to execute it. Culture is not what you say on the wall—it's what you do when no one is watching.

## Core Values: The Mars Mission Exercise

### What Are Core Values?

Core values are the non-negotiable principles that define WHO you are as an organization. They're not aspirational (what you want to be) but descriptive (what you already are at your best).

### The Mars Mission Exercise

**Setup**: Imagine you're starting a colony on Mars. You can only take 5-7 people from your current organization. The colony's survival depends on having people who embody the very best of your culture.

**The Process**:

**Step 1**: Leadership team individually lists 5-7 people they'd take
- Don't overthink it
- Gut instinct matters
- Mix of roles/levels

**Step 2**: Compare lists, find overlaps
- Who appears on multiple lists?
- Why these people specifically?

**Step 3**: Identify common characteristics
- What makes these people special?
- What behaviors do they consistently exhibit?
- What principles guide their decisions?

**Step 4**: Articulate the values
- Convert characteristics into value statements
- Make them memorable (2-3 words each)
- Define behavioral examples for each

**Step 5**: Test with "Mars Reject" exercise
- Who would you NEVER take to Mars?
- What values do they violate?
- Validates you've identified true values

### Atlassian Core Values Example

Through their Mars Mission exercise, Atlassian identified five values:

**1. "Don't #@!% the customer"**
- Customer success over short-term profit
- Behavioral example: Refusing to sell products customers don't need
- Anti-example: Pushing unnecessary upgrades

**2. "Build with heart and balance"**
- Sustainable intensity, not burnout culture
- Behavioral example: Encouraging vacation time
- Anti-example: Glorifying 80-hour weeks

**3. "Play as a team"**
- Collaboration over individual heroics
- Behavioral example: Sharing credit widely
- Anti-example: Territorial information hoarding

**4. "Be the change you seek"**
- Initiative without permission
- Behavioral example: Fixing problems when you see them
- Anti-example: "That's not my job" mentality

**5. "Open company, no bullshit"**
- Radical transparency
- Behavioral example: Sharing financials with all employees
- Anti-example: Withholding bad news

**The Result**: These values drive hiring, firing, recognition, and strategic decisions. They're referenced daily, not annually.

## Purpose: The "Why" Behind the Work

### Purpose vs. Mission vs. Vision

**Vision**: Where we're going (future state)
**Mission**: What we do (present activities)
**Purpose**: Why we exist (deeper meaning)

**Example - Patagonia**:
- **Vision**: Be the best outdoor apparel company
- **Mission**: Build the best products, cause no unnecessary harm
- **Purpose**: Save our home planet

Purpose connects daily work to deeper meaning.

### Discovering Your Purpose

**The Five Whys Exercise**:

**Question 1**: What does our company do?
- "We make project management software"

**Why does that matter?**
- "So teams can collaborate better"

**Why does THAT matter?**
- "So they waste less time and are more productive"

**Why does THAT matter?**
- "So they can go home to their families instead of working late"

**Why does THAT matter?**
- "Because work should enable life, not consume it"

**Purpose Discovered**: "We create software that gives people their lives back"

**The Test**: Does your purpose inspire employees beyond a paycheck?

## The Five Dysfunctions of Teams Framework

Patrick Lencioni's model explains why teams fail and how culture addresses root causes:

### Dysfunction 1: Absence of Trust
**Symptom**: Team members hide weaknesses, mistakes, and ask for help reluctantly
**Culture Solution**: Vulnerability-based trust
**Behavioral Example**: Leaders admit mistakes publicly, ask for help openly

### Dysfunction 2: Fear of Conflict
**Symptom**: Artificial harmony, passive-aggressive behavior, issues fester
**Culture Solution**: Healthy debate culture
**Behavioral Example**: "Strong opinions, weakly held" - debate ideas vigorously, commit fully after decision

### Dysfunction 3: Lack of Commitment
**Symptom**: Ambiguity about decisions, second-guessing, hedging
**Culture Solution**: Clarity and buy-in
**Behavioral Example**: Disagree-and-commit principle (disagree during debate, fully commit after decision)

### Dysfunction 4: Avoidance of Accountability
**Symptom**: Low standards, missed deadlines, no consequences
**Culture Solution**: Peer-to-peer accountability
**Behavioral Example**: Who-What-When public commitments, peers call out missed commitments

### Dysfunction 5: Inattention to Results
**Symptom**: Individual goals trump team goals, personal agendas dominate
**Culture Solution**: Collective focus on shared outcomes
**Behavioral Example**: Team scorecard visible to all, collective celebration/consequences

### Building Cohesive Teams

**Assessment**: Use Lencioni's team assessment tool quarterly
**Exercises**: Trust-building (personal histories), conflict practice (mining for disagreement)
**Rhythm**: Regular team health discussions
**Leadership Modeling**: Executives demonstrate desired behaviors first

## Making Values "Alive" in the Organization

### Integration Touchpoints

**1. Hiring**
- Values-based interview questions
- Candidate presentation to team about how they embody values
- Final interviews focus 50%+ on values fit

**Example Question for Atlassian's "Play as a Team"**:
"Tell me about a time you helped a colleague succeed at your own expense. What was the situation and what did you do?"

**2. Onboarding**
- First week includes values immersion
- New employees meet "culture carriers"
- Stories of values in action shared

**Zappos Example**: Week-long culture training before job training. Offer $2,000 to quit after week one if values don't fit. Few take it—but those who do save company from bad hires.

**3. Performance Reviews**
- 50% competency, 50% values alignment
- Specific examples required ("In Q2, John demonstrated 'Customer First' by...")
- Consequences for values violations, even if performance strong

**4. Recognition Programs**
- Monthly/quarterly awards tied to values
- Peer nominations (not manager-driven)
- Public storytelling about values in action

**Example - Ritz-Carlton**:
Daily 15-minute "lineup" meetings share stories of employees living "We are Ladies and Gentlemen serving Ladies and Gentlemen" value. Stories become cultural legends.

**5. Decision-Making**
- Strategy decisions tested against values
- "Does this align with our core values?" is explicit checkpoint
- Values trump short-term profit when conflicts arise

## Culture and Accountability

### The "No Brilliant Jerks" Rule

**Principle**: High performers who violate values must go
**Why**: Keeping them signals values don't matter
**Example**: Netflix culture deck explicitly states "Do not tolerate brilliant jerks. The cost to teamwork is too high."

### Performance-Values Matrix

**High Performance + High Values**: Stars (promote, retain, clone)
**High Performance + Low Values**: Brilliant jerks (coach or remove)
**Low Performance + High Values**: Cultural fits needing development (train, relocate, or exit with respect)
**Low Performance + Low Values**: Easy exit decision

**The Tough Call**: Brilliant jerks. They deliver results but poison culture. Scaling Up philosophy: remove them. Culture compounds over time; short-term pain, long-term gain.

## Building Trust at Scale

### Vulnerability-Based Trust

**NOT**: Predictability trust ("I trust you'll do what you say")
**IS**: Vulnerability trust ("I trust you enough to show weakness")

**How to Build**:
- Leaders share personal stories (failures, fears, growth)
- Team exercises reveal personal backgrounds
- Psychological safety to admit "I don't know" or "I made a mistake"

### Personal Histories Exercise

**Format**: Team gathering, 30-60 minutes
**Each person shares** (5 minutes):
- Where you grew up
- Siblings and family structure
- Unique childhood challenge
- First job

**Why It Works**: Understanding someone's background builds empathy and connection. Hard to stay in conflict with someone whose story you know.

## Culture Carriers and Champions

### Identifying Culture Carriers

**Characteristics**:
- Embody values naturally
- Tell culture stories spontaneously
- Peers seek them out for advice
- Often (but not always) long-tenure employees

**Role**:
- Mentors for new employees
- Values ambassadors
- Early warning system for culture drift

### Building Culture Champion Network

**Structure**: 5-10% of workforce (informal designation)
**Activities**:
- Quarterly culture health meetings
- Feedback on culture initiatives
- Story collection and sharing
- Onboarding support

**Mom's Organic Market Example**: "Culture Keepers" program with 15 employees (out of 300). They meet quarterly to discuss culture health, propose initiatives, and mentor new hires. Turnover among Culture Keepers: <5% annually vs. 35% industry average.

## Measuring Culture Health

### Quantitative Indicators
- Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS)
- Turnover rate (overall and top performers)
- Internal promotion rate
- Employee engagement survey scores
- Glassdoor/review site ratings

### Qualitative Indicators
- Stories shared in meetings
- How conflicts are resolved
- What gets celebrated
- What behaviors are tolerated
- Language used in hallways

### Culture Audits

**Quarterly Questions**:
1. Can every employee articulate our core values?
2. Can they give examples of values in action?
3. Have we made tough decisions that reinforced values?
4. Are values integrated into hiring, reviews, recognition?
5. Would new employees describe our actual culture as matching stated values?

## Common Culture Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Values as Wall Art
**Symptom**: Values posted everywhere but never referenced
**Solution**: Integrate into every people process and decision

### Pitfall 2: Too Many Values
**Symptom**: 10+ core values (impossible to remember)
**Solution**: 3-5 maximum, each truly non-negotiable

### Pitfall 3: Aspirational vs. Actual
**Symptom**: Values describe who we want to be, not who we are
**Solution**: Mars Mission exercise reveals true current values

### Pitfall 4: Keeping Brilliant Jerks
**Symptom**: High performers exempt from values expectations
**Solution**: No exceptions—exit the brilliant jerks

### Pitfall 5: Leadership Misalignment
**Symptom**: Executives don't model values
**Solution**: Start at the top or don't start at all

## The Bottom Line

Culture is the operating system on which all strategy executes. Get it right and scaling becomes easier. Get it wrong and growth tears the company apart.

**The Numbers**: Companies with strong, clearly-defined cultures show:
- 3-4x higher revenue growth
- 50% lower turnover
- 2x higher employee engagement
- Better customer satisfaction scores

**The Investment**: Culture work is hard, ongoing, and never "done." But it's the highest-leverage investment in scaling.

**Start Here**: Run the Mars Mission exercise this month. Discover your true core values. Then begin the work of making them real in hiring, firing, recognizing, and deciding.

Your culture is already there. The question is whether you'll be intentional about it.
