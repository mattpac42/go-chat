# Scaling Up: People Retention & Energy Management Summary

## The Retention Crisis

Employee turnover is one of the most expensive problems in scaling companies. The numbers are sobering:

- **Direct costs**: Recruiting, onboarding, lost productivity during ramp-up
- **Indirect costs**: Team disruption, knowledge loss, customer impact
- **Total cost**: 1.5-2.0x annual salary per departed employee

**The Paradox**: Companies invest heavily in hiring A players, then fail to keep them engaged and growing.

## The Love/Loathe Exercise

### What Is It?

A powerful self-assessment tool that helps employees identify what energizes vs. drains them at work. Created by Lois Melbourne, this exercise has transformed retention at hundreds of scaling companies.

### The Process

**Step 1: Individual Reflection** (30 minutes alone)

Create two lists:

**LOVE** (What energizes me):
- Specific tasks, responsibilities, interactions
- Moments when time flies
- Work that makes me eager to get to the office
- Activities I'd do even if not required

**LOATHE** (What drains me):
- Specific tasks that feel like drudgery
- Work I procrastinate on
- Activities that exhaust me
- Things I do only because I have to

**Example - Marketing Manager Sarah**:

**LOVE**:
- Brainstorming creative campaigns
- Analyzing customer data for insights
- Presenting to leadership team
- Mentoring junior marketers
- Writing compelling copy

**LOATHE**:
- Budget spreadsheet management
- Repetitive social media posting
- Vendor contract negotiations
- Monthly report formatting
- Scheduling meetings

**Step 2: Manager One-on-One** (60 minutes)

**Discussion Framework**:
1. Share your LOVE list - what patterns do you see?
2. Share your LOATHE list - what patterns emerge?
3. Explore: How can we increase LOVE activities to 80%+ of your time?
4. Strategize: How can we minimize, eliminate, or redistribute LOATHE activities?

**Step 3: Action Planning**

Create concrete plan to shift work composition:

**Sarah's Action Plan**:
- **Increase LOVE**:
  - Lead monthly campaign brainstorms (new responsibility)
  - Take on two junior marketers as formal mentees
  - Present quarterly marketing strategy to board

- **Decrease LOATHE**:
  - Delegate budget tracking to finance team analyst
  - Hire social media coordinator for routine posting
  - Train admin assistant on report formatting
  - Use scheduling software instead of email chains

**Step 4: Quarterly Review**

Revisit every 90 days:
- What % of time in LOVE vs. LOATHE activities?
- What's working? What needs adjustment?
- Have new LOATHEs emerged?

### The Results

**Lois Melbourne's Data**: Companies implementing Love/Loathe consistently:
- 40-60% reduction in voluntary turnover
- 25-35% increase in productivity
- 50%+ improvement in engagement scores

**Why It Works**:
- Makes implicit frustrations explicit
- Focuses on energy, not just skills
- Creates actionable retention plans
- Shows employees company cares about their experience

## Energy vs. Skill: The Melbourne Matrix

### The Framework

Traditional talent management focuses on **skills** (what you CAN do). Melbourne's insight: **energy** (what energizes you) matters as much or more for retention and performance.

### The Four Quadrants

**High Skill + High Energy = Star Zone**
- Work you're great at AND love
- Peak performance and engagement
- This is the target state
- Example: Sarah doing creative campaign strategy

**High Skill + Low Energy = Burnout Zone**
- Work you're great at but drains you
- Common trap: "You're so good at this, keep doing it"
- Leads to quiet quitting and eventual departure
- Example: Sarah managing budgets (skilled but hates it)

**Low Skill + High Energy = Growth Zone**
- Work you love but haven't mastered yet
- Highest engagement, steep learning curve
- Invest in training to move to Star Zone
- Example: Sarah presenting to board (loves it, building skill)

**Low Skill + Low Energy = Exit Zone**
- Work you're bad at and hate
- Eliminate, delegate, or automate immediately
- Example: Sarah formatting reports

### Strategic Implications

**For Retention**:
- Move employees toward Star Zone (high skill + high energy)
- Avoid trapping people in Burnout Zone (high skill + low energy)
- Invest in Growth Zone activities (high energy + developing skill)
- Eliminate Exit Zone work entirely

**For Performance**:
- Peak performance comes from Star Zone work
- Even skilled work drains performance if low energy
- Energy unlocks extra discretionary effort

**The 80/20 Goal**: Target 80% of employee time in Star Zone or Growth Zone, maximum 20% in Burnout or Exit Zones.

## The Dream On Program

### John Ratliff's Innovation

John Ratliff (Appletree Answers) created this program after realizing employee personal dreams often conflicted with work demands, creating quiet resentment and eventual turnover.

### How It Works

**Step 1: Dream Collection**

Employees answer: "What's a personal dream you'd pursue if you had unlimited time and money?"

**Examples**:
- Run a marathon
- Learn to play guitar
- Visit all 50 states
- Write a novel
- Master a new language
- Start a side business

**Step 2: Company Support**

Company provides resources to help employees achieve dreams:
- Time off for training/pursuit
- Financial support (budget allocated)
- Team encouragement and accountability
- Public celebration of milestones

**Step 3: Progress Tracking**

Dreams become part of quarterly check-ins:
- What progress on your dream?
- What obstacles?
- What support do you need?

### Real Examples from Appletree

**Employee Dream**: Complete Iron Man triathlon
**Company Support**:
- Flexible schedule for training
- $500 toward race fees/equipment
- Team fundraising for charity component
- Company-wide celebration when completed

**Result**: Employee stayed with company 6+ years (vs. 2-year industry average), became culture champion

**Employee Dream**: Record an album
**Company Support**:
- Studio time allowance
- Showcase event at company meeting
- Album release party hosted by company

**Result**: Employee loyalty skyrocketed, attracted other creatively-minded talent

### The ROI

**Cost**: $500-2,000 per employee per year
**Return**:
- Retention improvement (saves $30K-150K per prevented departure)
- Engagement increase (discretionary effort = 15-20% productivity gain)
- Culture enhancement (attracts A players)
- Employer brand (word-of-mouth recruiting)

**Net**: 10-20x ROI on retention and engagement alone

## Peer Coaching and Mentorship

### Why Peer Coaching?

**Traditional Mentorship Limits**:
- Senior people lack time
- Hierarchical dynamics limit honesty
- Doesn't scale beyond small companies

**Peer Coaching Advantages**:
- Mutual growth (both learn)
- Psychological safety (no power dynamics)
- Scalable (everyone participates)
- Builds cross-functional relationships

### The Sapient Boot Camp Model

Sapient (now Publicis.Sapient) created intensive onboarding that paired new hires with peer coaches:

**Structure**:
- Two-week intensive onboarding
- Each new hire paired with someone 6-18 months ahead
- Peer coach commits 10 hours over first 90 days
- Structured check-ins at 30, 60, 90 days

**Peer Coach Role**:
- Answer "dumb questions" that feel too basic for managers
- Share unwritten rules and cultural norms
- Provide safe space for concerns
- Accelerate relationship building

**Results**:
- Time to productivity cut 40%
- 90-day turnover dropped from 15% to 3%
- Peer coaches developed leadership skills
- Network effects strengthened culture

### Implementing Peer Coaching

**Step 1: Match Criteria**
- Different departments (build cross-functional knowledge)
- Similar career stage but not direct competitors
- Complementary strengths (designer with engineer, etc.)

**Step 2: Structure**
- Monthly 60-minute sessions
- Agenda: wins, challenges, learning, support needed
- Quarterly goal-setting together

**Step 3: Training**
- Coaching skills basics (listening, questioning, not solving)
- Confidentiality agreements
- How to give/receive feedback

**Step 4: Track Impact**
- Participation rates
- Satisfaction surveys
- Retention comparison (coached vs. non-coached)

## Onboarding for Retention

### The Critical First 90 Days

**Research**: 33% of employees know within first week if they'll stay long-term
**Implication**: Onboarding is retention strategy, not just training

### Effective Onboarding Elements

**Week 1: Belonging**
- Workspace ready day one (no "we're still setting up your laptop")
- Team lunch/welcome event
- Culture immersion (values, history, stories)
- Clear 90-day roadmap

**Week 2-4: Contribution**
- Meaningful project (not just training)
- Quick win opportunity
- Regular check-ins (daily week 1, then weekly)
- Peer coach introduction

**Days 30-60: Integration**
- Cross-functional meetings
- Customer/user exposure
- First deliverable completion
- Formal 30-day review

**Days 60-90: Acceleration**
- Increased autonomy
- Contribution to quarterly rocks
- 90-day review against job scorecard
- Decision: fully onboard, needs support, or not a fit

### Zappos's Offer to Quit

**The Program**: After first week of culture training, offer $2,000 to quit if not a good fit

**Why**:
- Self-selection (people who don't fit leave)
- Commitment (those who stay have consciously chosen to)
- Values signal (we care about fit more than filling seats)

**Results**: <3% take the offer, but those who stay have 40% longer tenure

## Common Retention Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Assuming Money Solves Everything
**Reality**: Money is table stakes. Energy, growth, and purpose drive retention.
**Solution**: Love/Loathe + growth plans matter more than 5% raises

### Mistake 2: Promoting Without Considering Energy
**Reality**: Best engineer may hate managing people
**Solution**: Ask about energy for new role before promoting

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Burnout Zone Workers
**Reality**: High performers in low-energy work will leave
**Solution**: Regular Love/Loathe reviews catch this early

### Mistake 4: Generic Development Plans
**Reality**: "Develop leadership skills" doesn't motivate
**Solution**: Personalized plans aligned to individual vision

### Mistake 5: Waiting Until Exit Interview
**Reality**: By resignation, it's too late
**Solution**: Quarterly stay interviews ("What would make you leave?")

## Bottom Line

Retention is not an HR program—it's a leadership discipline. Companies that keep A players engaged and growing scale faster and with less disruption.

**The Numbers**:
- Improving retention from 70% to 90% saves $500K-2M annually (100-person company)
- Engaged employees are 18% more productive and 23% more profitable
- Replacing departed A players takes 6-12 months (productivity gap)

**The Commitment**: Invest 1-2 hours per employee per quarter on Love/Loathe, one-page plans, and coaching

**Start Here**:
1. Run Love/Loathe exercise with your team this quarter
2. Create one-page personal plans for each direct report
3. Implement peer coaching for next new hire
4. Track: What % of each employee's time is in Star Zone?

Keep your A players engaged and they'll build your company for decades, not just years.
