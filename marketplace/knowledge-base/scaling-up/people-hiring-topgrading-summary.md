# Scaling Up: Hiring & Top Grading Summary

## The A-Player Imperative

"A players hire A players. B players hire C players." - Steve Jobs

The single most important decision in scaling is who you hire. Get hiring right and growth accelerates. Get it wrong and you're constantly firefighting.

## What is Top Grading?

**Top Grading** is a hiring methodology developed by Brad Smart focused on systematically hiring A players and removing chronic B and C players.

### Defining A, B, and C Players

**A Players (Top 10%)**:
- Consistently exceed expectations
- Take initiative without prompting
- Elevate those around them
- Deliver results in ambiguous situations
- Live company values authentically

**B Players (Middle 70%)**:
- Meet expectations reliably
- Need clear direction
- Solid contributors
- Good culture fit
- Can become A players with development

**C Players (Bottom 20%)**:
- Miss expectations regularly
- Require constant oversight
- Drain team energy
- Poor culture fit or performance
- Should be exited

### The A Player Standard

**Key Principle**: A player in THIS role, at THIS time, in THIS company

Not abstract excellence—specific excellence for your current needs.

**Example**: An A player VP of Sales at a $10M company may be a B or C player at a $100M company. Skills, experience, and temperament must match the specific challenge.

## The Cost of Mis-Hires

### The Brutal Math

**Direct Costs**:
- Recruiting fees (15-25% of salary)
- Salary and benefits during employment
- Severance costs

**Indirect Costs** (the real killers):
- Lost productivity (hiring manager's time = 50% for 3-6 months)
- Team morale impact
- Customer/project failures
- Opportunity cost (what an A player would have achieved)

**Bradford Smart's Research**: A mis-hire costs 15x the person's base salary when all factors included

**Example**: $80K salary mis-hire = $1.2M total cost

### Beyond Money: Cultural Impact

One C player on a team:
- Lowers standards ("If they can get away with it, why can't I?")
- Drains A player energy (they pick up the slack)
- Drives A player attrition (A players won't work with C players long-term)

**Jack Welch's 20-70-10 Rule**: Remove bottom 10% annually, develop middle 70%, reward top 20%. Controversial but mathematically sound—removing C players makes room for A players.

## The Four Killer Questions Framework

To avoid mis-hires, ask these four questions in EVERY reference call (not the final interview—actual reference calls with previous managers):

### Question 1: "On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate this person's performance?"

**Listen for**:
- Hesitation before answering (red flag)
- Anything below an 8 (not an A player)
- Enthusiastic 9-10 with examples (A player signal)

**Follow-up**: "Can you give me specific examples of what made them a [rating]?"

### Question 2: "What were this person's biggest strengths?"

**Listen for**:
- Specific examples vs. generic platitudes
- Strengths relevant to your role
- Passion in the telling

**Red Flag**: Vague answers ("They were fine," "Pretty good team player")

### Question 3: "What were this person's biggest areas for development?"

**Critical**: Everyone has weaknesses. The question is whether they're deal-breakers for YOUR role.

**Listen for**:
- Honesty (if they say "none," dig deeper—no one is perfect)
- Coachable weaknesses vs. character flaws
- Weaknesses irrelevant to your role vs. critical gaps

**Example**: "Struggled with long-term strategic thinking" is fine for a tactical execution role, disqualifying for a VP Strategic Planning role.

### Question 4: "Would you hire this person again?"

**The Truth Revealer**: This is where references often get honest.

**Listen for**:
- Immediate "Yes!" vs. hesitation (tells you everything)
- "Yes, but..." (proceed with caution)
- "It depends on the role..." (not an A player for them)
- "In the right situation..." (no)

**Follow-up**: "Why or why not?" and listen carefully.

## The Top Grading Interview Process

### Step 1: Job Scorecard Development

**BEFORE posting job**, create a one-page scorecard:

**Mission**: What needs to be accomplished in this role?
**Outcomes**: 3-5 measurable results expected in first year
**Competencies**: 5-7 must-have capabilities
**Values Fit**: Which core values are most critical?

**Example - Head of Customer Success**:

**Mission**: Build scalable customer success function that drives 90%+ retention

**Outcomes**:
1. Reduce churn from 8% to 5% within 12 months
2. Implement customer health scoring for all enterprise accounts
3. Build CS team from 2 to 8 people
4. Achieve 50+ NPS score

**Competencies**:
- Customer empathy
- Data-driven decision making
- Team building and leadership
- Process creation
- Cross-functional collaboration

**Values Fit**: "Customer First" and "Build for Scale"

**Why Scorecards Matter**: Clarity prevents hiring for "fit" or "gut feel"—you hire for specific outcomes.

### Step 2: Sourcing A Players

**Where NOT to Find A Players**:
- Job boards (A players aren't actively looking)
- Recruiter spam (A players ignore it)

**Where to Find A Players**:
- **Referrals from A players** (highest success rate—40%+ of hires should come from referrals)
- **Passive sourcing** (identify them at competitors, reach out directly)
- **"Fishing Holes"** (industry events, communities, thought leaders)
- **Recruiting firms with exclusive relationships** (not contingency recruiters)

**The Referral System**:
- A players know A players
- Offer referral bonuses (materially significant—$5K-25K depending on role)
- Make referrals easy (simple form, fast response)

**Mom's Organic Market Example**: 60% of hires come from employee referrals. Referral bonus: $2,000. Referred employees have 50% longer tenure and 20% higher performance ratings.

### Step 3: The Tandem Interview Method

**Traditional Problem**: Single interviewer has biases, misses signals, forgets details

**Tandem Solution**: Two interviewers, defined roles

**Interviewer 1 (Questioner)**:
- Asks the questions
- Follows the script
- Digs deeper on answers

**Interviewer 2 (Scribe/Observer)**:
- Takes detailed notes
- Watches body language
- Notes inconsistencies
- Asks clarifying questions

**Benefits**:
- 50% reduction in mis-hires (Smart's data)
- More accurate assessment
- Two perspectives = better decisions
- Better note-taking for reference checks

**Post-Interview Debrief** (15 minutes immediately after):
- Compare notes independently first
- Discuss discrepancies
- Rate candidate against scorecard
- Decision: advance, decline, or need more info

### Step 4: The Chronological Interview

**Purpose**: Walk through entire career chronologically, looking for patterns

**Format** (90-120 minutes):

**For each role** (15-20 minutes):
1. "What were you hired to do?" (mission clarity)
2. "What did you actually accomplish?" (results orientation)
3. "What were your biggest mistakes?" (self-awareness, learning)
4. "Who were your key colleagues and how would they rate you?" (future reference sources)
5. "Why did you leave?" (patterns of departure)

**Listen for Patterns**:
- Do they take accountability or blame others?
- Do accomplishments become more impressive over time (growth) or less (stagnation)?
- Are departures voluntary and positive or pushed out?
- Do they speak well of previous colleagues or trash them?

**Red Flags**:
- Can't name specific accomplishments
- Blames others for failures
- Vague about reasons for leaving
- Negative about every previous employer

**Green Flags**:
- Specific metrics and outcomes
- Takes ownership of mistakes
- Growth trajectory clear
- Speaks respectfully of former colleagues

### Step 5: Focused Behavioral Interviews

**Structure**: Each interviewer takes 1-2 competencies from scorecard and digs deep

**Format**: STAR Method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)

**Example - Testing "Data-Driven Decision Making"**:

**Question**: "Tell me about a time you had to make an important decision without complete data. Walk me through your process."

**Listen for**:
- **Situation**: Describes context clearly
- **Task**: Explains what needed to be decided
- **Action**: Details analytical approach (what data they gathered, how they analyzed it, who they consulted)
- **Result**: Specific outcome and learning

**Follow-ups**:
- "What data did you wish you had?"
- "How did you know when you had enough information?"
- "What would you do differently now?"

**Quality Signals**: Specificity, reflection, learning from experience

### Step 6: Values Interview

**Purpose**: Assess cultural fit and values alignment

**Format**: Present scenarios that test core values

**Example - Testing Atlassian's "Don't #@!% the Customer"**:

**Scenario**: "Imagine a customer wants a refund for a product they've been using for 11 months. Our policy is 30-day refunds only. The customer is angry and threatening to post negative reviews. What do you do?"

**A Player Answer**: Explores customer situation, looks for win-win, prioritizes relationship over policy

**C Player Answer**: "Policy is policy, no refund"

**Red Flag Answer**: "I'd offer a partial refund to shut them up"

### Step 7: Reference Checks (The Real Interview)

**When**: After final interviews but BEFORE offer

**Who**: At least 3 references, including:
- Direct manager from most recent role
- Peer colleague
- Direct report (if applicable)

**Use the Four Killer Questions**: See above framework

**Additional Questions**:
- "How did they compare to others in similar roles?"
- "What environment do they thrive in?"
- "What type of manager brings out their best?"
- "If I hire them, what should I know to set them up for success?"

**The Back-Channel Reference**: Beyond official references, find someone who worked with candidate (LinkedIn is gold for this). Often more honest than official references.

## The "Ruthlessly Compassionate" Exit

### When to Exit C Players

**Trigger Points**:
- 90-day review shows poor fit
- Performance improvement plan fails
- Values violations
- Skill gaps uncloseable

**The Compassionate Approach**:
1. Honest conversation early ("This isn't working")
2. Clear expectations and timeline
3. Support for transition (severance, outplacement)
4. Respectful exit process

**Why "Ruthless"**: Keeping someone in wrong role is unkind to them, unfair to team, and costly to company

**Why "Compassionate"**: Exit with dignity, support, and honest feedback helps them find right fit elsewhere

## The Top Grading Culture

### Making Top Grading Systematic

**Annual Talent Review**:
- Rate every employee: A, B, or C
- Action plans for each category:
  - **A players**: Retain, reward, promote
  - **B players**: Develop to A or accept as solid contributors
  - **C players**: Improve or exit (90-day plan)

**The 90-Day Rule**: Every new hire reviewed at 90 days against scorecard. Mis-hire identified = immediate action.

**Welch's 20-70-10 Applied**:
- Top 20%: Bonuses, promotions, retention focus
- Middle 70%: Development plans, coaching
- Bottom 10%: Exit or dramatic improvement required

### Overcoming "We Can't Find A Players"

**Common Objection**: "A players are too expensive / hard to find / won't work here"

**Reality Check**:
- One A player outperforms 2-3 B players
- A players attract other A players
- Recruiting effort pays off 15x

**The Math**:
- Spend 3x longer finding A player
- Pay 1.5x market rate
- Get 3-5x output
- Net result: Massive ROI

**Brad Smart's Data**: Companies with 90%+ A players grow 3-5x faster than companies with <50% A players

## Common Hiring Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Hiring for "Culture Fit" Without Definition
**Problem**: "Fit" becomes "people like me"
**Solution**: Define values clearly, hire for values + scorecard

### Mistake 2: Rushing to Fill the Seat
**Problem**: Desperation leads to lowered standards
**Solution**: "Hire slow, fire fast" principle

### Mistake 3: Interviewer Bias
**Problem**: First impression, confirmation bias, affinity bias
**Solution**: Structured interviews, tandem method, scorecard-based evaluation

### Mistake 4: Skipping Reference Checks
**Problem**: Miss critical warning signs
**Solution**: Always do references, use Four Killer Questions

### Mistake 5: Keeping C Players Too Long
**Problem**: Culture erosion, A player attrition
**Solution**: 90-day reviews, annual talent assessments, swift action

## Bottom Line

Hiring is THE most important activity for scaling companies. The difference between A and B players compounds over time—an organization of A players scales exponentially faster.

**The Commitment**: Invest 3-5x more time in hiring to get 10-15x better outcomes

**Start Here**:
1. Create job scorecard for next hire
2. Implement tandem interviews immediately
3. Use Four Killer Questions for all reference checks
4. Review current team: A, B, or C?
5. Make tough decisions on C players

Build a team of A players and scaling becomes inevitable.
