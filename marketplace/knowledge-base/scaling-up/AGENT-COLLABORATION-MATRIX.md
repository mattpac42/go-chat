## Collaboration by Integration Type

### Sequential Collaboration (One Coach → Next Coach)

**Pattern**: Complete work with one coach, then engage next coach to build on it

**Example 1**: Culture → Hiring → Retention
1. **scalingup-people-culture-coach** - Discover core values through Mars Mission
2. **scalingup-people-hiring-coach** - Build values-based interview questions
3. **scalingup-people-retention-coach** - Create values-aligned onboarding

**Example 2**: Strategy → Priorities → Metrics
1. **scalingup-strategy-planning-coach** - Create one-page strategic plan
2. **scalingup-execution-priorities-coach** - Set quarterly rocks aligned to annual plan
3. **scalingup-execution-metrics-coach** - Design KPIs measuring rock progress

### Parallel Collaboration (Multiple Coaches Simultaneously)

**Pattern**: Engage multiple coaches at same time for integrated solution

**Example 1**: Quarterly Planning Session
- **scalingup-execution-priorities-coach** - Facilitates rock-setting
- **scalingup-execution-metrics-coach** - Designs success metrics for each rock
- **scalingup-cash-management-coach** - Forecasts cash requirements for rocks
- **scalingup-people-hiring-coach** - Identifies hiring needs to achieve rocks

**Example 2**: First 90 Days for New Leadership Team

### Continuous Collaboration (Ongoing Partnership)

**Pattern**: Two or more coaches work together repeatedly

**Partnership 1**: Execution Habits + Execution Priorities
- Daily huddles surface blockers → Weekly meetings track rock progress → Quarterly planning sets new rocks
- Ongoing cycle of rhythm (habits) feeding focus (priorities)

**Partnership 2**: People Culture + People Hiring + People Retention
- Values guide hiring → Great hires need great onboarding → Retention insights improve culture
- Continuous people system improvement

**Partnership 3**: Strategy + Cash
- Strategic decisions analyzed for cash implications → Cash constraints shape strategic choices

## Best Practices for Multi-Agent Collaboration

### 1. Start with Assessment

Before engaging multiple agents, use **scalingup-growth-advisor** to:
- Assess all 4 pillars
- Identify primary constraint
- Recommend specialist sequence
- Create integrated action plan

### 2. Sequence Thoughtfully

**Foundation First**: Culture and strategy before execution and metrics
**Build Systems**: Habits before priorities, priorities before metrics
**People Foundation**: Culture → Hiring → Retention

### 3. Allow Integration Time

Don't rush from one coach to next:
- Implement habits coach recommendations for 4-6 weeks before adding priorities coach
- Let values discovery settle before launching hiring system redesign
- Give new systems time to stabilize before adding complexity

### 4. Track Cross-Pillar Impact

When one coach makes recommendations, check impact on other pillars:
- New quarterly rocks → cash requirements?
- Strategic shift → people implications?
- Cash optimization → execution rhythm changes?

### 5. Use Growth Advisor for Coordination

For complex multi-agent projects, keep growth advisor engaged to:
- Coordinate specialist coaches
- Track integrated progress
- Manage dependencies
- Ensure balanced improvement

---

## Summary: Agent Collaboration Philosophy

**Single agents** solve specific problems (no meeting rhythm, unclear values, cash flow issues)

**Multiple agents** build integrated systems (execution discipline, people systems, strategy clarity)

**Growth advisor + all agents** drive comprehensive scaling (4-pillar balance, constraint relief, 2-3x growth)

**The key**: Match complexity of solution to complexity of problem. Don't over-engineer simple issues, but don't under-invest in systemic transformation.
