# Scaling Up: Strategy & Cash Combined Summary

## Part 1: Strategy - The One-Page Strategic Plan

### Why One Page?

**The Problem**: Strategic plans that are 40-page PowerPoint decks that no one reads, understands, or executes.

**The Solution**: One-page strategic plan that everyone can see, understand, and reference daily.

### The One-Page Framework

**Section 1: Core Purpose and Values**
- **Purpose**: Why the company exists beyond making money
- **Core Values**: 3-5 non-negotiable principles
- **Mars Mission**: The people who embody these values

**Section 2: Core Customer**
- **Who**: Specific profile of ideal customer
- **Geographic**: Where they are
- **Demographics/Firmographics**: Detailed characteristics
- **Psychographics**: Motivations, pain points, desires

**Mom's Organic Market Example**:
**Core Customer**: "Health-conscious families in mid-Atlantic region who value organic, local, and sustainable food and will pay premium prices for quality and convenience."

**NOT Core Customer**: Price-sensitive shoppers, single-item convenience buyers, industrial food acceptors

**Section 3: Brand Promise**
- **Promise**: What you deliver that competitors don't
- **Proof Points**: Evidence you keep the promise
- **Word Ownership**: The one word you want to own in customer minds

**Example - Zappos**:
- **Brand Promise**: "Deliver WOW through service"
- **Proof Points**: Free shipping both ways, 365-day returns, 24/7 support, surprise upgrades
- **Word**: "Service"

**Section 4: 3-5 Year Goals (The Painted Picture)**
- Revenue target
- Market position
- Capabilities built
- Customer metrics
- Team size and structure

**Example - SaaS Company**:
- $50M ARR (from $10M today)
- #1 market share in vertical
- 95% customer retention rate
- 200 employees (from 40 today)
- Presence in 3 countries

**Section 5: Annual Priorities (Rocks)**
- 3-5 major initiatives for the year
- Each aligned to 3-5 year goals
- Each measurable and owned

**Section 6: Quarterly Theme and Rocks**
- Single focus for 13 weeks
- 3-5 quarterly priorities
- Weekly commitments (Who-What-When)

**Section 7: Critical Numbers**
- 5-10 KPIs that measure strategy execution
- Leading and lagging indicators
- Weekly review cadence

## SWOT Analysis Done Right

### Traditional SWOT Problems
- Generic platitudes ("Our people are our strength")
- No prioritization (20 items per quadrant)
- No action plans (analysis without execution)

### Scaling Up SWOT Approach

**Step 1: Honest External Analysis**

**Opportunities** (External factors you can leverage):
- Market trends favoring your solution
- Competitor weaknesses you can exploit
- Technology shifts enabling new capabilities
- Regulatory changes opening markets

**Threats** (External factors that could hurt you):
- New competitors entering market
- Substitute products emerging
- Customer behavior shifts
- Economic/regulatory headwinds

**Mom's Organic Market 2023 SWOT**:

**Opportunities**:
- Organic food market growing 12% annually
- Amazon-Whole Foods merger creating service gaps
- Local food movement accelerating
- Gen Z prioritizing sustainability

**Threats**:
- Conventional grocers adding organic sections
- Direct-to-consumer organic brands (Thrive Market)
- Rising real estate costs in urban markets
- Supply chain disruptions for organic products

**Step 2: Brutal Internal Assessment**

**Strengths** (Internal capabilities that are truly differentiated):
- Resources competitors can't match
- Capabilities that create competitive advantage
- Assets that drive customer preference
- Processes that enable superior execution

**Weaknesses** (Internal gaps that limit growth):
- Missing capabilities needed for strategy
- Resource constraints
- Process bottlenecks
- Structural limitations

**Mom's Organic Market 2023 SWOT** (continued):

**Strengths**:
- 30-year local supplier relationships
- Cult-like customer loyalty (NPS: 75)
- Employee retention 2x industry average
- Prime urban locations in DC/Baltimore

**Weaknesses**:
- Limited technology infrastructure
- No e-commerce capability
- Dependence on founder knowledge
- Inconsistent processes across stores

**Step 3: Strategic Priorities from SWOT**

Match strengths to opportunities:
- **SO Strategy**: Leverage local relationships + growing local food trend = expand local supplier program to 60% of products

Match weaknesses to threats:
- **WT Strategy**: Build e-commerce to counter direct-to-consumer competitors

**The Key**: SWOT drives specific, actionable quarterly rocks, not generic wish lists.

## OGSM Framework

### What is OGSM?

**Objective**: Long-term aspiration (qualitative)
**Goals**: Medium-term targets (quantitative)
**Strategies**: How you'll achieve goals (approaches)
**Measures**: How you track progress (metrics)

### Example - SaaS Company Growth

**Objective**: Become the essential platform for legal teams in mid-market law firms

**Goals** (3 years):
- $30M ARR
- 500 law firm customers
- 90% net revenue retention
- #1 market share in 50-500 attorney segment

**Strategies**:
1. Product-led growth for acquisition (free tier → paid conversion)
2. Customer success-led expansion (land small, expand to firm-wide)
3. Partnership-led distribution (legal tech ecosystem integrations)
4. Content-led positioning (thought leadership in legal tech)

**Measures**:
- **Strategy 1 Measures**: Free trial signups, trial-to-paid conversion rate, time to first value
- **Strategy 2 Measures**: Net retention rate, seats per customer, upsell rate
- **Strategy 3 Measures**: Partner-sourced deals, integration usage, co-marketing reach
- **Strategy 4 Measures**: Inbound leads from content, share of voice, speaking engagements

**The Power**: OGSM creates tight linkage from aspiration to action to measurement.

## Brand Promises and Word Ownership

### The Brand Promise

**Definition**: The specific, tangible value you consistently deliver that competitors don't.

**Characteristics**:
- **Specific**: Not "quality" but "delivered in 2 days or it's free"
- **Provable**: Can demonstrate through customer experience
- **Differentiated**: Competitors can't or won't match
- **Valuable**: Customers care deeply

**Examples**:
- **FedEx**: "When it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight"
- **Ritz-Carlton**: "We are Ladies and Gentlemen serving Ladies and Gentlemen"
- **Geek Squad**: "We'll fix it or it's free"

### Word Ownership

**Concept**: Own one word in customer minds (Al Ries & Jack Trout positioning)

**Examples**:
- **Volvo**: Safety
- **BMW**: Performance
- **Disney**: Magic
- **Apple**: Design
- **Amazon**: Convenience

**How to Identify Your Word**:
1. What do customers say about you unprompted?
2. What would you be devastated to lose as your reputation?
3. What can you defend through resources and capabilities?
4. What word is ownable (not already taken by dominant competitor)?

**Mom's Organic Market's Word**: "Local" (not organic—Whole Foods owns that)

**Strategic Implication**: Every decision tests against: "Does this reinforce our word?"

## Part 2: Cash - The Oxygen of Growth

### Cash vs. Profit

**The Paradox**: Profitable companies go bankrupt due to cash flow
**Why**: Profit is accounting concept, cash is reality

**Example**: $1M sale booked in Q1 (profit shows), cash collected in Q4 (6-month payment terms). Meanwhile, must pay employees, rent, suppliers monthly.

**Result**: "Profitable" on paper, bankrupt in reality.

## The Cash Conversion Cycle

### What Is It?

The number of days between paying suppliers and collecting from customers.

**Formula**: Days Inventory Outstanding + Days Sales Outstanding - Days Payables Outstanding

**Components**:

**1. Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO)**
- How long inventory sits before being sold
- Formula: (Average Inventory / Cost of Goods Sold) × 365
- Goal: Minimize (unless strategic buffer needed)

**2. Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)**
- How long to collect payment after sale
- Formula: (Accounts Receivable / Revenue) × 365
- Goal: Minimize through better payment terms

**3. Days Payables Outstanding (DPO)**
- How long until you pay suppliers
- Formula: (Accounts Payable / Cost of Goods Sold) × 365
- Goal: Maximize without damaging relationships

**Example**:
- DIO: 45 days (inventory turnover)
- DSO: 60 days (customer payment terms)
- DPO: 30 days (supplier payment terms)
- **Cash Conversion Cycle**: 45 + 60 - 30 = **75 days**

**Implication**: For every dollar of revenue, you're out of pocket for 75 days before getting paid.

### The Power of Improvement

**Scenario**: $10M annual revenue, 75-day cash conversion cycle

**Current State**: Need $2.05M in working capital ($10M ÷ 365 days × 75 days)

**Improved State**: Reduce cycle to 45 days
- DIO: 30 days (better inventory management)
- DSO: 45 days (tighter payment terms)
- DPO: 30 days (maintain supplier relationships)
- **New Cycle**: 30 + 45 - 30 = **45 days**
- **Working Capital Needed**: $1.23M

**Cash Freed**: $820K (can fund growth instead of borrowing)

## The Power of One (7 Levers)

### The Framework

Seven levers that impact cash. Improving each by just 1% has multiplicative effects.

**Lever 1: Price**
- Increase prices 1%
- Flows directly to bottom line (if volume holds)

**Lever 2: Volume**
- Increase units sold 1%
- Spreads fixed costs over more revenue

**Lever 3: Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**
- Reduce by 1% through supplier negotiations, efficiency
- Direct impact on gross margin

**Lever 4: Overhead**
- Reduce operating expenses 1%
- Increases net profit

**Lever 5: Accounts Receivable**
- Collect 1% faster
- Frees working capital

**Lever 6: Inventory**
- Reduce inventory 1%
- Frees working capital, reduces carrying costs

**Lever 7: Accounts Payable**
- Extend payment terms 1% (without penalties)
- Keeps cash in business longer

### The Multiplication Effect

**Example - $10M Revenue Business**:

**Baseline**:
- Revenue: $10M
- COGS: 40% ($4M)
- Overhead: 50% ($5M)
- Net Profit: 10% ($1M)
- Cash: $500K

**After 1% Improvement on Each Lever**:

**Lever 1 - Price**: +1% = $100K additional revenue
**Lever 2 - Volume**: +1% = $100K additional revenue (with proportional COGS)
**Lever 3 - COGS**: -1% = $40K savings
**Lever 4 - Overhead**: -1% = $50K savings
**Lever 5 - AR**: Collect 1% faster = $27K cash freed
**Lever 6 - Inventory**: Reduce 1% = $10K cash freed
**Lever 7 - AP**: Pay 1% slower = $10K cash preserved

**Net Impact**: ~$330K+ profit improvement and $47K working capital freed

**Key Insight**: Small improvements across all levers compound. Don't search for the one 30% improvement—make seven 1-5% improvements.

## Customer-Funded Business Models

### The Holy Grail

Get customers to fund your growth instead of investors or banks.

### Classic Examples

**Dell (1990s-2000s)**:
- **Model**: Collect payment before building computers
- **Timing**: Customers paid upfront, Dell paid suppliers 30-60 days later
- **Result**: Negative cash conversion cycle (customers funded operations)
- **Growth**: Scaled to $60B revenue with minimal outside capital

**Costco**:
- **Model**: Membership fees fund operations, product sales are near-break-even
- **Timing**: Collect annual memberships upfront, turn inventory 12+ times/year
- **Result**: Cash influx before expenses
- **Growth**: $200B+ revenue, largely self-funded

**Starbucks**:
- **Model**: Gift cards and loyalty program
- **Timing**: Customers load $1B+ onto cards/app (interest-free loan to Starbucks)
- **Result**: Billions in working capital from customer prepayment
- **Float**: ~$1.6B in stored value at any time

**SaaS Companies**:
- **Model**: Annual prepayment for software
- **Timing**: Collect 12 months upfront, deliver service monthly
- **Result**: Cash today, recognize revenue over 12 months
- **Growth**: Use customer cash to fund product development

### How to Move Toward Customer-Funded

**Strategy 1: Shift Payment Terms**
- Offer discounts for upfront annual payment
- Reduce payment terms (net 60 → net 30)
- Require deposits on large orders

**Strategy 2: Create Prepayment Programs**
- Membership models
- Retainer agreements
- Subscription pricing

**Strategy 3: Accelerate Delivery**
- Reduce production cycles
- Just-in-time inventory
- Drop-shipping where possible

## Managing Bank Relationships

### Banks as Strategic Partners

**Traditional View**: Banks are commodity lenders (shop for best rate)
**Scaling Up View**: Banks are strategic partners in growth

### John Ratliff's 2008 Crisis Example

**Context**: Financial crisis, banks calling loans on healthy businesses

**Ratliff's Preparation** (before crisis):
- Quarterly meetings with banker (not just annual reviews)
- Shared strategic plans and financial projections
- Invited banker to company events
- Made bank feel like partner, not just creditor

**When Crisis Hit**:
- Bank knew Ratliff's business intimately
- Trusted management team
- Understood temporary market disruption vs. business failure
- **Result**: Maintained credit lines while competitors lost access

**Lesson**: Build relationships during good times to have support during bad times.

### Best Practices for Bank Relationships

**1. Choose Relationship Banks**:
- Local/regional banks (relationship-focused) over mega-banks (transaction-focused)
- Banker who knows your industry
- Bank with appetite for your company size

**2. Communicate Proactively**:
- Quarterly meetings minimum (even if no financing needed)
- Share good and bad news (no surprises)
- Invite banker to see operations

**3. Provide Transparent Financials**:
- Monthly financial packages (even if not required)
- 13-week cash flow forecasts
- Strategic plan updates

**4. Build Multiple Relationships**:
- Don't depend on single bank
- Maintain 2-3 banking relationships
- Reduces risk if one bank exits relationship

**5. Understand Banker Incentives**:
- Bankers want secure loans, not maximum returns
- Show how you mitigate risk
- Make it easy for banker to champion your business internally

## Cash Flow Forecasting

### The 13-Week Cash Flow Forecast

**Why 13 Weeks**:
- Quarter ahead visibility
- Weekly granularity (catches surprises early)
- Matches quarterly planning rhythm

**Structure**:

```
Week 1: Apr 1-7
Beginning Cash Balance: $500K

INFLOWS:
- Customer payments: $120K
- Other revenue: $10K
Total Inflows: $130K

OUTFLOWS:
- Payroll: $80K
- Rent: $15K
- Suppliers: $40K
- Other: $10K
Total Outflows: $145K

Net Cash Flow: -$15K
Ending Cash Balance: $485K

[Repeat for weeks 2-13]
```

**Critical**: Week 13 ending balance = your "cash runway" visibility

**Red Flags**:
- Ending balance below minimum threshold (typically 2-3 months expenses)
- Multiple consecutive negative weeks
- Large one-time outflows not matched with inflows

**Actions**:
- Accelerate collections
- Delay non-critical expenses
- Arrange financing before cash crisis

### The Cash Flow Meeting

**Frequency**: Weekly for companies <$10M revenue, bi-weekly for larger
**Attendees**: CFO, CEO, key operational leaders
**Duration**: 15-30 minutes

**Agenda**:
1. Review last week forecast vs. actual (variances?)
2. Update next 13 weeks based on new information
3. Identify risks to forecast
4. Assign action items to address risks

**Mom's Organic Market**: Weekly cash meetings prevented three potential crises by catching early warning signs 4-6 weeks in advance.

## Common Cash Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Focusing on Profit, Ignoring Cash
**Problem**: "We're profitable but can't make payroll"
**Solution**: Track cash conversion cycle weekly

### Mistake 2: Growing Too Fast
**Problem**: Growth consumes cash faster than generated
**Solution**: Know your "growth ceiling" based on cash availability

### Mistake 3: Loose Payment Terms
**Problem**: Net 60-90 payment terms kill cash
**Solution**: Negotiate net 30 or offer discounts for early payment

### Mistake 4: Excess Inventory
**Problem**: Cash sitting in unsold inventory
**Solution**: Just-in-time inventory, demand forecasting

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Working Capital Needs
**Problem**: Surprised by cash crunch during growth
**Solution**: Calculate working capital requirements for each revenue target

## Integration: Strategy Drives Cash Needs

### The Connection

**Strategic Decision**: Enter new market
**Cash Implication**: Upfront investment before revenue

**Strategic Decision**: Move upmarket to enterprise customers
**Cash Implication**: Longer sales cycles = longer cash conversion

**Strategic Decision**: Add product line
**Cash Implication**: Inventory investment, production costs before sales

**The Discipline**: Every strategic initiative must include cash flow analysis

### Example - SaaS Company

**Strategy**: Move from SMB to enterprise market

**Strategic Implications**:
- Higher deal sizes ($100K vs. $10K)
- Better retention (95% vs. 85%)
- Premium pricing

**Cash Implications**:
- 6-9 month sales cycles (vs. 1 month)
- Heavier sales resources needed upfront
- Implementation costs before revenue recognition
- **Working Capital Hit**: Need 6-9 months cash buffer

**Solution**:
- Raise capital before transition
- Maintain SMB business for cash flow during transition
- Offer annual prepay discounts to enterprise customers

## Bottom Line

**Strategy without cash awareness fails**: The best strategic plan dies if you run out of cash executing it.

**Cash without strategy wastes resources**: Cash efficiency matters, but only in service of strategic growth.

**Integration is everything**: Strategic planning and cash management must happen together, not separately.

**Start Here**:
1. Calculate your cash conversion cycle today
2. Build 13-week cash flow forecast this week
3. Run Power of One analysis—which levers move most?
4. Review strategy through cash lens—what's the working capital requirement?
5. Build bank relationship before you need it

Master strategy and cash together, and scaling becomes predictable, not precarious.
